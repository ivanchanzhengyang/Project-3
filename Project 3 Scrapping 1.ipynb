My biggest problem is beers, especially in summer I drink almost daily a few beers and in the weekends even more.\\n\\nI started IF 1,5 week ago now and I am curious if im doing things right. \\n\\nI installed Myfitnesspal for counting calories and 2100 is my daily goal to lose 1 pound a week. I eat dinner at 18.00 and eat breakfast the next day between 10.00 and 11.00, so thats 16-8/17-7 right?\\n\\nMy daily calorie intake is 1800 - 2000 and healthy, but the weekend is tough. I have kids who like to eat fastfood once a week and besides that I had 8 beers this weekend (way less then before, but still a lot), so the weekends I get above my goal (2400 and 2600 friday and saturday).\\n\\nI sport like 2-3 times a week, tennis for at least 1 hour a time. \\n\\nSo now you know my story I have a few questions:\\n\\n1. Is it ok to have a few beers in the weekend? I want to lose weight but thinking about no alcohol anymore is tough, I really like my beer in the weekend (it's a bad habit, I know!). \\n2. With IF 16-8 /17-7 I still have breakfast and lunch, do I need to skip a meal, or is it 'normal' to have breakfast and lunch?\\n\\nCurious about your thoughts and advice! \\n\\nCheers\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</td>\n",

I’ve been having a really hard time with breaking my rules, and I just wanted to ask for some advice on ideas for how to get used to breaking these rules/how to get rid of these rules from my life entirely.\\nI’ve mostly been trying to just be conscious of when these rules come into play, like if I go to do something and it goes against one of my rules and because of that I feel bad about doing it, and trying to work against that thought process. But it’s been hard, and maybe it’s just that it’s a slow process, but I wanted to ask if anybody has any advice on this. Ideas for ways to better do this or ideas of other ways that you all have used to get past your rules would be so greatly appreciated\\nThank you :)</td>\n",

My biggest problem is beers, especially in summer I drink almost daily a few beers and in the weekends even more.\\n\\nI started IF 1,5 week ago now and I am curious if im doing things right. \\n\\nI installed Myfitnesspal for counting calories and 2100 is my daily goal to lose 1 pound a week. I eat dinner at 18.00 and eat breakfast the next day between 10.00 and 11.00, so thats 16-8/17-7 right?\\n\\nMy daily calorie intake is 1800 - 2000 and healthy, but the weekend is tough. I have kids who like to eat fastfood once a week and besides that I had 8 beers this weekend (way less then before, but still a lot), so the weekends I get above my goal (2400 and 2600 friday and saturday).\\n\\nI sport like 2-3 times a week, tennis for at least 1 hour a time. \\n\\nSo now you know my story I have a few questions:\\n\\n1. Is it ok to have a few beers in the weekend? I want to lose weight but thinking about no alcohol anymore is tough, I really like my beer in the weekend (it's a bad habit, I know!). \\n2. With IF 16-8 /17-7 I still have breakfast and lunch, do I need to skip a meal, or is it 'normal' to have breakfast and lunch?\\n\\nCurious about your thoughts and advice! \\n\\nCheers\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;   \n",

I usually break my fast around \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. Is this regime fine? \\n2. Does my feeding window *have* to be after my IF workout window **or** am I okay with this setup?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am worried I am working out and not in a fasted state suddenly even though it is normally 12 hours after my meal intake. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAppreciate the help and feedback from you all. Thanks :)   \n",

He was an older black man with a very weird manner of speaking.\\n\\n- Very slow cadence, choice of words was odd and deliberate\\n- Says he eats nuts and berries once a day\\n- Claimed to be a doctor or something…\\n- might of been some stuff about anti-aging…\\n\\nThat’s all I can reliably remember. The guy who introduced me to him was kind of mental as well so I started getting cult vibes.\\n\\nOnly asking here because he presented as some sort of subject matter expert on fasting so thought he might have popped up in these circles.\\n\\n\\nP.S. It’s really scary to post something like this in a new sub because I have no idea what I’m in for.\\n\\nTop 3 Predictions:\\n\\n- “Never heard of him…”\\n- “Yeah, that guy was crazy! Here’s a link!” \\n- “How dare you insult the trans-dimensional Messiah!”   \n",

I’ve been in recovery for a bit now, not all that long but long enough where I’ve made some notable progress. But what I’ve found is that one of the hardest things for me to get over is food rules. I’ve been having a really hard time with breaking my rules, and I just wanted to ask for some advice on ideas for how to get used to breaking these rules/how to get rid of these rules from my life entirely.\\nI’ve mostly been trying to just be conscious of when these rules come into play, like if I go to do something and it goes against one of my rules and because of that I feel bad about doing it, and trying to work against that thought process. But it’s been hard, and maybe it’s just that it’s a slow process, but I wanted to ask if anybody has any advice on this. Ideas for ways to better do this or ideas of other ways that you all have used to get past your rules would be so greatly appreciated\\nThank you :)   \n",
       "1985  for context, i have struggled with disordered eating for the majority of my life, due to an extensive history with CSA and abuse. after being in (my first) relationship with a narcissist, i developed full-blown AN, and it got pretty bad fairly quickly. for the past three years, i have struggled to feel okay in my body, feel like i deserve to eat, etc. My body has worn itself down to next to nothing, to put it bluntly, and although I have attempted recovery on my own, it has never proven successful past the point of bringing my body to a slightly more livable form. \\n\\nthroughout the entirety of this disorder, i have lived with my mother, who adamantly refuses to admit/ accept that i do in fact have an eating disorder, despite being medically diagnosed in her presence. she has watched me torment myself, break down over numbers and my body, obsess, and she has bore witness to the brunt of my cognitive impairments brought on by AN (especially losing my personality, which she has commented on nearly as much as my weight). \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\naround two or so months ago, i had gotten myself in \\*deep\\* trouble for some not-so-great decisions of mine, and whilst she was scolding and berating me, she brought up anorexia. i told her that i resented her for never getting me any sort of help, and for never even being there for me herself, and her reply back has sent me into an emotional downfall. \"i dont believe you have anorexia, i really do think you're doing this all for attention\". that was her exact response. \\n\\ni tried giving her the benefit of the doubt- perhaps she said it out of emotion in the moment- however, she reiterated that statement several times in a sound state of mind, and i am devastated, to put it lightly. i have struggled with so much, and have neared death on several occasions now. \\n\\ni know that i should not let her words affect my recovery, but that alongside some other events in my life have caused me to spiral further and further down the relapse rabbit-hole. in my head, the only way to get my mother's approval (of which i so desperately vie for) is to get exponentially worse, even perhaps die, just so she will listen. \\n\\ni really do love my mother, i just want (and need) her to see me, instead of pushing me aside and writing me off. i just want to feel like i am not faking it.    \n",

Been getting a sick thrill out of it every single time without fail, even though I don’t believe a word of it. How can I believe it with my stomach and thighs the way they are? 🥲 Still nice to hear for that quick second, though.   \n",

My biggest problem is beers, especially in summer I drink almost daily a few beers and in the weekends even more.\\n\\nI started IF 1,5 week ago now and I am curious if im doing things right. \\n\\nI installed Myfitnesspal for counting calories and 2100 is my daily goal to lose 1 pound a week. I eat dinner at 18.00 and eat breakfast the next day between 10.00 and 11.00, so thats 16-8/17-7 right?\\n\\nMy daily calorie intake is 1800 - 2000 and healthy, but the weekend is tough. I have kids who like to eat fastfood once a week and besides that I had 8 beers this weekend (way less then before, but still a lot), so the weekends I get above my goal (2400 and 2600 friday and saturday).\\n\\nI sport like 2-3 times a week, tennis for at least 1 hour a time. \\n\\nSo now you know my story I have a few questions:\\n\\n1. Is it ok to have a few beers in the weekend? I want to lose weight but thinking about no alcohol anymore is tough, I really like my beer in the weekend (it's a bad habit, I know!). \\n2. With IF 16-8 /17-7 I still have breakfast and lunch, do I need to skip a meal, or is it 'normal' to have breakfast and lunch?\\n\\nCurious about your thoughts and advice! \\n\\nCheers\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</td>\n",

But it’s been hard, and maybe it’s just that it’s a slow process, but I wanted to ask if anybody has any advice on this.

I have kids who like to eat fastfood once a week and besides that I had 8 beers this weekend (way less then before, but still a lot), so the weekends I get above my goal (2400 and 2600 friday and saturday).\\n\\nI sport like 2-3 times a week, tennis for at least 1 hour a time. \\n\\nSo now you know my story I have a few questions:\\n\\n1. Is it ok to have a few beers in the weekend? I want to lose weight but thinking about no alcohol anymore is tough, I really like my beer in the weekend (it's a bad habit, I know!). \\n2. With IF 16-8 /17-7 I still have breakfast and lunch, do I need to skip a meal, or is it 'normal' to have breakfast and lunch?\\n\\nCurious about your thoughts and advice! \\n\\nCheers\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;   \n",

I usually break my fast around \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. Is this regime fine? \\n2. Does my feeding window *have* to be after my IF workout window **or** am I okay with this setup?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am worried I am working out and not in a fasted state suddenly even though it is normally 12 hours after my meal intake. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAppreciate the help and feedback from you all. Thanks :)   \n",

He was an older black man with a very weird manner of speaking.\\n\\n- Very slow cadence, choice of words was odd and deliberate\\n- Says he eats nuts and berries once a day\\n- Claimed to be a doctor or something…\\n- might of been some stuff about anti-aging…\\n\\nThat’s all I can reliably remember. The guy who introduced me to him was kind of mental as well so I started getting cult vibes.\\n\\nOnly asking here because he presented as some sort of subject matter expert on fasting so thought he might have popped up in these circles.\\n\\n\\nP.S. It’s really scary to post something like this in a new sub because I have no idea what I’m in for.\\n\\nTop 3 Predictions:\\n\\n- “Never heard of him…”\\n- “Yeah, that guy was crazy!

I’ve been in recovery for a bit now, not all that long but long enough where I’ve made some notable progress. But what I’ve found is that one of the hardest things for me to get over is food rules. I’ve been having a really hard time with breaking my rules, and I just wanted to ask for some advice on ideas for how to get used to breaking these rules/how to get rid of these rules from my life entirely.\\nI’ve mostly been trying to just be conscious of when these rules come into play, like if I go to do something and it goes against one of my rules and because of that I feel bad about doing it, and trying to work against that thought process. But it’s been hard, and maybe it’s just that it’s a slow process, but I wanted to ask if anybody has any advice on this. Ideas for ways to better do this or ideas of other ways that you all have used to get past your rules would be so greatly appreciated\\nThank you :)   \n",
       "1921  for context, i have struggled with disordered eating for the majority of my life, due to an extensive history with CSA and abuse. after being in (my first) relationship with a narcissist, i developed full-blown AN, and it got pretty bad fairly quickly. for the past three years, i have struggled to feel okay in my body, feel like i deserve to eat, etc. My body has worn itself down to next to nothing, to put it bluntly, and although I have attempted recovery on my own, it has never proven successful past the point of bringing my body to a slightly more livable form. \\n\\nthroughout the entirety of this disorder, i have lived with my mother, who adamantly refuses to admit/ accept that i do in fact have an eating disorder, despite being medically diagnosed in her presence. she has watched me torment myself, break down over numbers and my body, obsess, and she has bore witness to the brunt of my cognitive impairments brought on by AN (especially losing my personality, which she has commented on nearly as much as my weight). \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\naround two or so months ago, i had gotten myself in \\*deep\\* trouble for some not-so-great decisions of mine, and whilst she was scolding and berating me, she brought up anorexia. i told her that i resented her for never getting me any sort of help, and for never even being there for me herself, and her reply back has sent me into an emotional downfall. \"i dont believe you have anorexia, i really do think you're doing this all for attention\". that was her exact response. \\n\\ni tried giving her the benefit of the doubt- perhaps she said it out of emotion in the moment- however, she reiterated that statement several times in a sound state of mind, and i am devastated, to put it lightly. i have struggled with so much, and have neared death on several occasions now. \\n\\ni know that i should not let her words affect my recovery, but that alongside some other events in my life have caused me to spiral further and further down the relapse rabbit-hole. in my head, the only way to get my mother's approval (of which i so desperately vie for) is to get exponentially worse, even perhaps die, just so she will listen. \\n\\ni really do love my mother, i just want (and need) her to see me, instead of pushing me aside and writing me off. i just want to feel like i am not faking it.    \n",

Been getting a sick thrill out of it every single time without fail, even though I don’t believe a word of it. How can I believe it with my stomach and thighs the way they are? 🥲 Still nice to hear for that quick second, though.   \n",
