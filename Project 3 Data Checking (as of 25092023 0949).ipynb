       "1  I decided who I wanted to be and I became her üíÖüèΩ So a little background: I‚Äôm 39, have birthed two children and at 5‚Äô2, used to weigh 220 lbs for about a decade. I‚Äôm sitting around 150 lbs right now. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years since I started this intermittent fasting lifestyle and it‚Äôs the first time I didn‚Äôt gain ALL OF the weight back plus more. But I did fall off a bit last year and gained back about 25 lbs, 20 of which I‚Äôve lost again. That regain did teach me something though. About how to handle stress. About not giving up when there are setbacks. About being grateful for every stage of the journey you‚Äôre at. I‚Äôve currently been doing mostly a 20/4 schedule but eating whatever I want to satiety within my window‚Ä¶ and the rest of the time I‚Äôm just chillin‚Äô. üòé   \n",

I‚Äôm sitting around 150 lbs right now. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years since I started this intermittent fasting lifestyle and it‚Äôs the first time I didn‚Äôt gain ALL OF the weight back plus more. But I did fall off a bit last year and gained back about 25 lbs, 20 of which I‚Äôve lost again. That regain did teach me something though. About how to handle stress. About not giving up when there are setbacks. About being grateful for every stage of the journey you‚Äôre at. I‚Äôve currently been doing mostly a 20/4 schedule but eating whatever I want to satiety within my window‚Ä¶ and the rest of the time I‚Äôm just chillin‚Äô. üòé   \n",

It works! Once I got disciplined with fasting it became so easy to stay consistent. I had rapid weight gain due to a medication but now feeling much more confident. To compliment IF, I do cardio 3-4 times a week. 11 more pounds to go !! You can do this !   \n",

I feel like I‚Äôm approaching the end of my road and at this point I am ready to stop fighting and give up. I want to eat, I want to recover, but I feel like it‚Äôs a forever cycle I‚Äôm stuck on of restricting, hitting rock bottom, binging, and then restricting again.   \n",

Like for me as soon as I was getting better my now boyfriend asked me out. Which was great but also what starting my eating disorder in the first place years ago so it was soooo hard to not relapse (& I kinda did a bit). \\n\\nI‚Äôd love to hear your stories with this if it‚Äôs similar!

And its not their fault but oh my god. My entire family has been downstairs all day until 30 mins ago when everyone but my dad went out to get groceries. So I just psyched myself up to make ramen. I‚Äôm 1 minute away from being done and in comes my dad whose chosen this exact moment to make his food as well. I cant explain the amount of anger I felt. I literally just had to go back to my room and leave my food in the kitchen. I feel like a crazy person. I honestly don‚Äôt mind eating in front of other people that much except for when it‚Äôs my parents. My mind is so frustrating.   \n",

I‚Äôm sitting around 150 lbs right now. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years since I started this intermittent fasting lifestyle and it‚Äôs the first time I didn‚Äôt gain ALL OF the weight back plus more. But I did fall off a bit last year and gained back about 25 lbs, 20 of which I‚Äôve lost again. That regain did teach me something though. About how to handle stress. About not giving up when there are setbacks. About being grateful for every stage of the journey you‚Äôre at. I‚Äôve currently been doing mostly a 20/4 schedule but eating whatever I want to satiety within my window‚Ä¶ and the rest of the time I‚Äôm just chillin‚Äô. üòé   \n",

It works! Once I got disciplined with fasting it became so easy to stay consistent. I had rapid weight gain due to a medication but now feeling much more confident. To compliment IF, I do cardio 3-4 times a week. 11 more pounds to go !! You can do this !   \n",

       "1  i decided who i wanted to be and i became her üíÖüèΩ so a little background: i‚Äôm 39, have birthed two children and at 5‚Äô2, used to weigh 220 lbs for about a decade. i‚Äôm sitting around 150 lbs right now. it‚Äôs been almost 3 years since i started this intermittent fasting lifestyle and it‚Äôs the first time i didn‚Äôt gain all of the weight back plus more. but i did fall off a bit last year and gained back about 25 lbs, 20 of which i‚Äôve lost again. that regain did teach me something though. about how to handle stress. about not giving up when there are setbacks. about being grateful for every stage of the journey you‚Äôre at. i‚Äôve currently been doing mostly a 20/4 schedule but eating whatever i want to satiety within my window‚Ä¶ and the rest of the time i‚Äôm just chillin‚Äô. üòé   \n",
