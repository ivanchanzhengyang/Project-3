Does fasting out of spite work?,"We‚Äôll see in 4 weeks when I go to a wedding where my b*%#h sister will also be attending. 

No, in all seriousness, I‚Äôve been off the wagon for so long and have fallen off quickly after starting up again. So I‚Äôm testing my new theory. üòâ

Will I stick to it this time out of spite, and to prove her wrong about fasting not being a realistic way to live and to lose weight. So far she has proven me wrong because although I‚Äôve lost weight before, I gained it all back and more. And I hate when she is right. So maybe that‚Äôs my new MO just to get me started again.

90 Days of Intermittent Fasting - IT WORKS!,"Hi Everyone, 

Today was the 90th day of my Intermittent Fasting (IF) and honestly it‚Äôs changed my life, 

I started at 245lbs, I loved weight lifting, loved doing exercise however I hated nutrition. Every week I‚Äôd be on chicken and rice just to blow it at the weekend eating and drinking without a care in the world. 

I‚Äôll hold my hands up and say I‚Äôve had a few wobbles I‚Äôve had the odd takeaway or had a good drink at the weekend, I even lost some motivation half way through. However, I always stuck to an 8 hour eating window, I have tried 16:8, 20:4 and even OMAD, I love how I don‚Äôt have to count the calories (just because I‚Äôm too lazy)

With IF I have found the energy to do more, I‚Äôm in the gym for 30 minutes 5 times a week training an individual muscle group, followed by a 15 minute sauna session 3/4 days a week, alongside at least an hour of high intensity exercise at least 2 hours a week. This is also alongside walking my dog for at least an hour a day. 

Today I weighed in at 205lbs, a 40lbs weight loss. I have seen people who have been doing IF post on how they‚Äôve lost more weight in the same amount of time or even less time, as great of an achievement that is, people need to get over comparing to others, I was that jealous person at first looking and thinking why isn‚Äôt that me. Now, I look back and think I was so daft to compare, what I‚Äôm doing now is a massive achievement something I didn‚Äôt expect to do this time last year. 

A lot of people I know has told me how I‚Äôve lost so much weight honestly I need to deflate my head a bit!!!

It‚Äôs great to hear however I know I have a way to go. My aim in the long term (2024) is to get to 180lbs and then start focusing on building muscle so if their any tips I am open to suggestions, I need the help!!",16sdl2e,17,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16sdl2e/90_days_of_intermittent_fasting_it_works/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-26 04:10:24

3 weeks in doing 2 meals a day (16/8),"The hunger was intense off and on during the first week, but eventually stopped occurring in week two. I think the most difficult part was the energy dips on week two along with the mood swings (mostly depression).

"My third week of IF, am I doing it right?","Good morning 

M 34, 3 weeks in H 182cm  SW 95kg CW 93kg GW 87kg 

I'm pretty new to IF,  never done it before or any diets for that matter. I am usually sticking to a 20/4 or 22/2 depending on how I feel. Last 3 years I've been working a less physical job but far more mentally draining, lackof energy to visit gym or do any form of physical activity after work. As a result I've been gaining weight, late night snacks and large consumption of alcohol. Since starting, certain clothes are already becoming looser and although 87kg is somewhat of a goal, my primary goal is getting back into 34"" trousers. I don't regularly weigh myself, because I don't want it to be a fixation point. 

Do you measure your own success by weight or cloth sizes?

I generally fast Sunday to Friday, Saturday is a cheat day where I allow myself more calories than usual, moderate alcohol. I haven't been counting macros/calories or carbs on the fasting days though, I generally just go with my gut feeling as I'm already beginning to see results. 

I eat cashew or almonds for a snack (if needed) before main meal, although sometimes I have it after or even both. Meals consist of protein source/carbs/veg/salad incl avocado, feta cheese etc. 

How do you feel about cheat days?
Do you count calories or carbs?
Do you regularly weigh yourself?
Whats your SW? CW? GW?

I recently tried the carnivore diet for over a month and enjoyed the mental health benefits that came with it. I would just get nausea too often so it wasn‚Äôt for me. I added back in some carbs and feel overall better. This past week I have been doing 20:4 fasting and love the way I start to feel at the on hours 12-20. But I noticed that I feel like garbage and get slight nausea after I eat. I eat clean and on the lower end of carbs. I purely doing this for mental health benefits, not weight loss at all.

Does anyone else feel like that after they eat? Is there some things I can do to help with that?

"""Body for Life"" vs Intermittent Fasting","[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body\_for\_Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_for_Life)

""Body for life"" recommends 6 small meals spaced every 3 or 4 hours instead 3 big meals. The explanation is that the body understands you are never starving and thefore doesn't need ""energy storage"" in the form of fat. I did that program many years years and got very good results, the best shape in my entire life (I have never been overweight). 

**Doesn't Intermittent Fasting do the opposite, in the sense that you stay longer periods without eating?** 

I'm aware of the insuline effect behind the (IF) theory, but to me the side effects of not eating for 12 hours are much worse. I feel like (IF) doesn't work for me since I literally got more belly fat since skipping breakfast and only between 12h-20h. 

**Am I correct in saying that  Intermittent Fasting doesn't work for everybody?**

For my diet I mainly eat whatever I was eating before OMAD but within my calorie deficit budget with the Lose It app. And just fill my plate with protein and fats and moderate carbs and eat till I am full and save the rest for another day, I don‚Äôt deprive myself of any sweets or surgery drinks but I stopped snacking.

MORNING OMAD,"(TLDR; Skip to last paragraph for my question. )

Hi! So last year I (f, 38, 164cm) managed to lose 8kg by doing OMAD and walking 10000 steps a day. My eating window was 3/4pm at work and in the evening I went for a walk to complete my steps. 

This year my work is more stressful and I cant eat during work, so I have moved my OMAD window to the evening and then it moves into 20/4 as I snack something whilst cooking. I also like to have a glass of wine whilst cooking and then the side of me that lacks self control ends up finishing the bottle and dinner happens way later than planned. Im then too tired to go complete my steps for the day. This lead to completely stopping fasting for a while, but lately Im back on the 20/4 with cheat weekends. 

My weight is now so close to not being overweight and I just finally want to cross that line and then get a safe distance under it. My goal being 62-64kg (im allowing for monthly female fluctuation.) So really not far to go, but I know I need to cut out the alcohol to achieve this. 

So I want to start doing OMAD in the mornings so I cant be tempted to drink in the evenings. 

Is anyone else doing morning OMAD? Im looking for food suggestions. I really like wraps/tortillas so thinking of stuff like breakfast burritos. But thats about all I can come up so far. Tips needed thanks!!",16qsb8d,7,1,https://i.redd.it/agx4s7qdy5qb1.jpg,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-24 08:24:08
Discipline is about planning. Personal thoughts about IF. Maybe they'll help others too.,"*This is a conversation I was having with myself, but I thought it might help other people too. I am not sure if this falls under the flair: Tips, Tricks, and Advice. It's mostly self-motivational stuff that everyone knows already. I just like to keep it into focus in my mind, so that I don't fail. IF is consistency. These are my little self-hacks to help me stay consistent.*

**TL;DR:**

Be Consistent, Set Goals, Cheat Days, Progress Pictures, Movement, Tracking, Eat Healthy, No Alcohol, Never Give Up, Love Yourself.

\----

# Discipline is about planning.

This is what I do.

**Set goals.**

I have my start weight and my end weight. I gave myself an extra liberal time frame to easily lose the weight. I'll be working at this all year. That's fine. I know the goal. Now here's the important part. If I screw up, it's fine. No big deal. It's a liberal weight loss plan, so all I have to do is tighten it up a little and maybe walk 15 minutes more for a few days and then I'm back on track. If I had some extreme schedule that I was pushing and I failed, I'd never catch up and I'd probably quit. Therefore, realistic, pain-free goals are key for me personally.

**Plan the Cheat Days.**

I'm not going to fast at my daughter's birthday party in a few days. I know this already. Therefore, I know right now that I am going to get a break on that day. This does three things for me.

1. I don't feel like garbage if I give in because I'm not giving in. I'm disciplined. I planned this cheat day.
2. It makes my regular discipline easier because I know in 5 days I'm going to get some cake.
3. I work a little hard in advance because I know the scale is going to tip upward. But that's ok. I'm disciplined, and I expect it. No mental anguish can come from it because it's planned. It's not a failure.

Planning cheat days each month is essential for me. I'm doing a 20:4 schedule, so for me, a cheat day is maybe doing a 16:8 and eating everything I feel like eating, including sweets.

**Progress Pictures.**

There is nothing like remembering where I came from. If I get out of the shower and look into the mirror and feel disgusted. It's time for a progress picture. I take a picture (which I hate) and then toss it into the folder on my desktop. Then, I sit down and get progress picture number 1 and compare it to today. My whole frame of reference shifts. I'm making progress and goddamn, I'll looking better than 3 months ago. That motivates me so much, I'll probably get outside and go for a walk.

**Movement and Tracking**

It's not just about eating less and looking better. For me, IF is about living longer. Longevity. The key for me is tracking. My number one tracking tool is my Samsung sport watch. I wear it all the time. It tracks not just my steps, but my heart rate and my arm movements.

I move more because of the watch. All types of movement have become habit. Sometimes, I'll stretch my arms up or out or just to the side. The watch knows this and tracks it. It's become habitual to constantly be moving my body, getting the blood flowing. I'm aware of it because the watch keeps track. I have found this to be amazingly beneficial in helping me transition away from being mostly sedentary into being more active.

The watch also encourages me to walk more. For example, I will park farther ways from a store just to walk 50 steps more each way. All those little movements and extra steps add up over time. I'm going to fail if I try to run 10 miles 4 times a week. For me, it's the slow gradual process of becoming more active while eating in a healthy manner.

**Processed Food, Fast Food, Soft Drinks**

I try to eat as healthy as possible now. Instead of eating some type of vegetable stir fry out of a frozen package, I chop up some fresh vegetables and fry them myself. It tastes better and has less calories. Instead of going and buying a fast food burger that's covered in salt and sugar sauce, get some meat and make a burger. It's cheaper, tastes better, is faster and has less calories. Soft drinks are calorie bombs. After quitting them for a while, soft drinks just taste bad now.

**Quit Alcohol**

Alcohol is a calorie rich beverage that makes me want to drink too much and eat poorly. It's also terrible for the body and mind. I didn't think I had an alcohol problem until I tried to quite for a few weeks. My god it was hard to stop. Like I said above, I want to increase my longevity and be healthier. That's not possible if I'm dumping sugar bombs into my mouth each day. (If you struggle like I do: r/StopDrinking helps).

Alcohol-free beer has become a delight. There are lots of minerals and vitamins in them. Plus, they are low in calories.

**Never Give Up**

The beauty of the intermittent fasting lifestyle is the reset possibility. If I fail for a week or two, so what? Make a progress picture and start again. This lifestyle change is amazingly forgiving. You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to be fast. All you really have to do is show up and never give up. The outcome will be the same. Better health.

**Summary.**

Be kind to yourself. Love yourself. You can do it. You are on the right path. Good luck. :)",16qrq4l,16,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16qrq4l/discipline_is_about_planning_personal_thoughts/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-24 07:48:18

Question about calories during eating window 36:12,"Hello, i'm doing a 36:12 intermittent fasting. I can manage pretty well for now, i'm at a week and half and i don't feel particularly hungry during the fasting windows. The issue is that the 12 hours eating isn't enough for me, since between university and all i'm usually around 1600 calories at best. For example, i'd do breakfast with a croissant with cream (yeah i don't care too much about what i eat,when i eat) and i'd be full for half day. I'm currently trying to lose 15 kg (from 87 to 68) and i'm 30+ years old. Is this an issue?should i force myself to eat more? honestly i'm not putting much thought into the macronutrient category but i usually end up eating most carb and fats and not many proteins (thinking of supplementing with high protein food like bars or something). Last time i ate around 2000 calories during the eating windows and i felt bloated till midday of the fasting day.

Not necessarily just IF but my bowel has improved tremendously.,"I don't know if it's because of gallbladder removal many years ago but, I have had bowel issues for a long time.  Never know what's going to set it off.  One day I'll eat a certain meal and everything's fine.  The next time (even next day) I eat it, will have explosive diarrhea within 15 minutes of eating.  One specific time comes to mind... I was at work and got a sandwich and chips.  I ate ONE chip, hadn't taken a bite of anything else, and had to run to the restroom.  Is this what is called ""dumping""?

Since starting IF/OMAD 4 weeks ago, I haven't had any fast food.  Have only had restaurant food once (Pad Thai).  I cook every meal with fresh ingredients.  No frozen or pre-packaged meals.  My meals mainly consist of beef/chicken/eggs, cheese, veggies, small amounts of fruit.  Little bread, no rice yet (my rice cooker died and I haven't replaced it), little pasta, and one tortilla if I make a burrito.  Small amount of potato.  Mostly just staple foods that can be made into anything.

PSA: Ensure adequate fiber intake,"Past two weeks I have had zero shift in weight, despite keeping up with a calorie deficit. I haven't done my usual ADF fasting (due to health issues, making it difficult to do longer fasts). This zero shift in weight caused significant mental stress with me, and created significant feelings of food shame (felt like I wasn't ""allowed"" to eat because I hadn't lost weight). I nearly quit, dead serious, nearly just gave up the other day because my weight had stagnated for so long and I felt defeated and like a failure.

Went for a run this morning, came back home, nearly didn't make it to the bathroom. I'll mark the below as spoiler, read on if you wanna hear about my bathroom journey.

>!Dropped the FATTEST turd, I'm talking a small hill, it came so high up in the bowl it nearly kissed my cheeks. I felt myself ascend, my body felt lighter, my abdomen lifted, my ovaries thanked me for the extra room. I sat there for 3 minutes, shitting the ENTIRE time, it was a spiritual journey.!<

I immeditely hopped on the scales. 

Weighed in at 84.2kg three weeks ago, and my weight has stayed that level the entire time, today? 82.8kg. 

TL;DR: Don't be like me. Increase your fiber intake. Less you wanna experience a life changing bathroom trip that leads to an almost 2kg loss.

IF vs Calorie Deficit,"Reposting from r/diet due to no responses.  

Anyone with some experience/knowledge on this subject?

I've been running an CD of about -700 a day for 50 days. I'm a 37 yo male, started at 169lbs and am down to 158 as of today. Recently however (last week or so) I've started IF as well, 17/7 basically (10am first calories, 5pm last calories), still consuming the same amount of calories a day. So IF is not helping me with my CD, as I can do that well enough without it. (I track everything via app)

So is IF still beneficial? Or is it just unnecessary? It's creating some minor annoyances, like for example I'm avoiding taking my fiber supplement in the morning because it has calories in it, pushing it off til breakfast. I'm avoiding fat free milk in my coffee cause it has calories in it. I'm avoiding a pretzel snack at 7pm because I'm outside my window.

Basic research seems to suggest that you need to be fasted for 24 hours + to induce autophagy to any significant extent, so I'm not hitting that mark anyway.

"skinny (32, f) doing IF (16/8) for only a few weeks and noticing ugly chin hair finally gone","hi there,

i am skinny doing IF (16/8, usually 1pm to 9pm) for non-weight loss reasons (have read and listened to podcasts about all the other benefits) and i have noticed one amazing main benefit. i have struggled for years with lots of small coarse black hairs sprouting from my chin (usually worst in the morning when waking up), requiring me to take tweezers everywhere and try not to get caught in sunlight (lol). it's not been a life-ruining problem but enough to be a hassle and knock my confidence. i have been told by doctors/internet it's probably just being over 30 (i'm 32) and having italian heritage.

however, after like 3 days of IF (16/8, 1pm to 9pm eating window), i noticed that my chin was so much smoother and the patch of hairs on my chin (a mixture of hairs and like black plugs that can be pushed out, gross sorry) is almost completely gone? this is even in the run-up to my period, when it was usually at its worst. this is a truly brilliant unexpected benefit for me, it has really cheered me up and motivated me to continue 16/8, so i just thought i should share.

i am aware of why this is likely happening - i know that insulin, a hormone, being raised constantly by eating messes with our other hormones. i suppose what i really didn't realise is that insulin is still raised by eating anything at all. i already ate very heathily due to a previous health problem (kale and eggs for breakfast and very limited sugar etc.) so i was always pretty confused as to why i still had this annoying chin hair problem. so it's very fascinating to learn that 16/8 'cures' it so quickly. Makes me wonder what other magic it's doing in the body!

"16:8 Irish Newbie, I need all the help and advice please üôè","Hey!! I'm F // 33 // 5ft2.

I did keto for years and stopped fully in Dev 2022 due to a depressive episode. It's been a tough year 2023 and have gone up from a 12 to 20 (UK sizes). Funnily enough never specifically did intermittent fasting on keto, but it's something I find easy to do as I never had a food routine so could go all day without eating etc.

Looking to loose weight and get back to a 10/12. So far finding 11am to 7pm a good window and want to try do 7 days a week with two hours walking a day.

Is there anything I should avoid during those 8 hours? Carbs, sugar etc? Should I cut all those out? Is there any advice on a meal planner day to day? Should I give myself a calorie limit? Is there anything available in Ireland to help the fasting ( squash for water etc?) Should I be doing a shorter window than 16:8, maybe 20:4  ?

I'm desperate to loose the weight so any help is very greatly appreciated x",16owl0p,11,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16owl0p/168_irish_newbie_i_need_all_the_help_and_advice/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-22 00:47:08

I've wanted to switch to 4pm but after looking some things up, Apparently it's better to be eating as early as you can so you can use up all your energy more throughout the day. It makes a lot of sense to me, but I don't know if it'll make that much of a difference in the rate that I'm losing weight at. I don't exercise often, as I'm more of the stay-at-home type. I went from being 300 all the way to currently sitting at 235 by eating around 700 calories a day and I want to keep going even further even faster. If I ate earlier, would I go down faster?

Some advice for f32 with normal bmi but some insulin resistance?,"Hey! Looking for some advice on whether IF is good for my situation and advice on what might be ideal for my situation. 

I‚Äôm a 32 yo woman with a normal (but on the upper end of normal) BMI. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 150. 

During my second and final pregnancy, I was surprised to have gestational diabetes. My endocrinologist says I probably have some insulin resistance. I hadn‚Äôt been super active since having my first child about 4 years ago, but my diet has been at least better than average (lots of veggies and protein, but some indulgences). 

Since my second was born a year ago, I‚Äôve picked up weight lifting, long walks, and have been eating pretty low carb. I generally eat one egg and one turkey sausage for breakfast.  then for lunch and dinner I choose one of those meals to be higher calorie/higher carb, while the other is a small snack meal. I don‚Äôt snack in between meals. In the late evening (8ish), I do have a 60 calorie thc drink or kombucha for relaxation, along with a small bowl of popcorn and one small dark chocolate. 

I‚Äôve had basically no weight loss since my second was born. I have seen some body recomposition with the weight lifting, and I do feel a lot better. However, I would really like to lose 15ish pounds just to help out my insulin resistance.

"Mindfulness program involves eating 1 raisin.. will this ""break"" my fast?","Sorry for the dumb question - I've subscribed to a mindfulness program and one of the first modules/parts involves something called ""the raisin exercise"" which seems to involve squeezing/rolling a raisin between fingers, putting it in the mouth, feeling the textures etc - and eventually eating it.

Just some encouragement for newbies,"This was a few years ago, but I always only owned one belt for my trousers. When you have a 64 inch waist they get expensive to have multiples. With previous belts, as I got fatter, I'd add notches to the end until I ran out of leather, and then pay 5x the price for new belt as normal folks.  


My very first ""OMG THIS IS WORKING!"" victory is when I had to add new holes GOING THE OTHER WAY!    


On my last 64-66 inch belt (which was at the end of the leather) all the holes were used, until I shrank and shrank until I had to add holes going the other way. When I finally retired it, it wraps all the way around my waist and tucks in behind my left hip. I added 8 or 10 holes going behind the previous original holes. And yes, I keep with me where ever I go.  


Watching scale numbers was disheartening, but that belt was the greatest motivator of all.

I didn‚Äôt notice I was losing weight ‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶ until I was sitting and realized I was more comfortable crossing my legs than before.

16:8 fast with exercise without protein shake OR 14:10 fast with exercise plus protein shake?,"Forgive me for the silly question, I‚Äôm new to IF! I‚Äôve been doing a 16:8 fast with the intention of overall health and weight loss in addition to regular exercise and novice calorie/macro counting. In attempts to build muscle, I would like to add a protein shake to the end of my workout.

The problem is, my only opportunity to exercise is at 9-10p, so having a protein shake after cuts into the beginning of my fast (8p to 12p fast).

For the IF and health gurus, for the intention of overall health, weight loss and muscle gain: should I continue my 16:8 IF without a protein shake after my nightly exercise? Or should I add on a protein shake after my exercise and do a 14:10 fast? I try to get 70g or so of protein throughout the day for a 62-ish kilo female but I‚Äôve read that consuming protein around the time of workout is ideal.

"Glucose Test, Gum and Zyns","I bought a glucose tester to see if gum or zyns would effect my glucose levels.
 
I first tested myself with nothing at 99mg/dl.
I chewed four pieces of pur gum for 30 minutes. My glucose level went down to 89mg/dl.

After that test I wanted to see if my spearmint zyn would affect my glucose levels so I put one in right after the last test. Less than 30 minutes later I retested and my glucose levels went up to 142mg/dl (honestly a little surprising).

I then retested two hours later to a level of 105mg/dl. I chewed two pieces of extra spearmint gum for 30 minutes and retested. It read 98mg/dl.

"26F ‚Äì Thinking of doing OMAD without CICO, looking for advice","I have been almost exclusively cooking homemade meals for my OMAD, and CICO has been driving me crazy. It almost doubles the amount of time I spend cooking. I usually make some type of protein with two sides, one ""carb"" and one veggie.

I'm looking for any advice from people who had a similar issue and found some type of solution to this.

I've been considering moving to a no CICO OMAD model. Currently, I can have 1,850 calories/day to lose around 1lb a week. I know some meals can be deceivingly high in calories (still recovering from learning 1 lb of ribeye steak was 1,300+ calories), but for long-term weight loss, do you all think OMAD + coffee/tea during the day without CICO is feasible?",16nt1av,4,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16nt1av/26f_thinking_of_doing_omad_without_cico_looking/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-20 18:44:32

The issue comes in because I feel energy drained. I bike for my errands and I get winded way to easily. Over all it feels like I have absolutely no glycogen stores for my body.

I've retained most of my muscle from the bulk and am eating around 500 less than TDEE, sometimes less sometimes more.

"New here, just curious about your opinions. Am I doing this right?","Hi all!

I'm a big guy, 6.4 feet, 240 pounds (I think, didn't weight myself for a few months) and done with my bad shape. My biggest problem is beers, especially in summer I drink almost daily a few beers and in the weekends even more.

I started IF 1,5 week ago now and I am curious if im doing things right.

I installed Myfitnesspal for counting calories and 2100 is my daily goal to lose 1 pound a week. I eat dinner at 18.00 and eat breakfast the next day between 10.00 and 11.00, so thats 16-8/17-7 right?

My daily calorie intake is 1800 - 2000 and healthy, but the weekend is tough. I have kids who like to eat fastfood once a week and besides that I had 8 beers this weekend (way less then before, but still a lot), so the weekends I get above my goal (2400 and 2600 friday and saturday).

I sport like 2-3 times a week, tennis for at least 1 hour a time.

So now you know my story I have a few questions:

1. Is it ok to have a few beers in the weekend? I want to lose weight but thinking about no alcohol anymore is tough, I really like my beer in the weekend (it's a bad habit, I know!).
2. With IF 16-8 /17-7 I still have breakfast and lunch, do I need to skip a meal, or is it 'normal' to have breakfast and lunch?

Curious about your thoughts and advice!

* My fasting window is between 3:30 PM - 7:30 PM. 
* I work out between 5AM - 8 AM depending on my work schedule and when I start work. I usually break my fast around 

&#x200B;

1. Is this regime fine? 
2. Does my feeding window *have* to be after my IF workout window **or** am I okay with this setup?

&#x200B;

I am worried I am working out and not in a fasted state suddenly even though it is normally 12 hours after my meal intake. 

&#x200B;

Appreciate the help and feedback from you all. Thanks :)",16nftnf,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16nftnf/if_204_working_out_and_fasting_window/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-20 08:24:07
Who was the crazy black dude from years back?,"
Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not insinuating that intermittent fasting is crazy,  just that there was a crazy guy who also happened to intermittent fast.

I might‚Äôve ran across this guy on YouTube in 2017. He was an older black man with a very weird manner of speaking.

- Very slow cadence, choice of words was odd and deliberate
- Says he eats nuts and berries once a day
- Claimed to be a doctor or something‚Ä¶
- might of been some stuff about anti-aging‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs all I can reliably remember. The guy who introduced me to him was kind of mental as well so I started getting cult vibes.

Only asking here because he presented as some sort of subject matter expert on fasting so thought he might have popped up in these circles.


P.S. It‚Äôs really scary to post something like this in a new sub because I have no idea what I‚Äôm in for.

Top 3 Predictions:

- ‚ÄúNever heard of him‚Ä¶‚Äù
- ‚ÄúYeah, that guy was crazy! Here‚Äôs a link!‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúHow dare you insult the trans-dimensional Messiah!‚Äù


EDIT: Our quack is ‚ÄúDr.‚Äù Nun Amen-Ra. The guy is clearly on steroids, has the mysterious confidence of Charles Manson and the koolAid drinking fan base to back it up! 

Thank god the IF community is rational and helpful, but holy cow did I come within inches of prediction 3‚Ä¶You should see what some of his fans think about ‚Äúawakened beings‚Äù and how they disavow thermodynamics.

"Fell off the wagon for 3 weeks, but it didn‚Äôt really matter.","I got a new job which is a totally different work schedule than I used to work.

I was eating anything and everything for the last 3 weeks. McDonald‚Äôs, donuts from the gas station, cereal with honey on it, processed foods.

However, a few days later, I got up and weighed myself again and was back in the 170‚Äôs. I‚Äôve realized my body has adjusted to being smaller than it used to be. This has been all the encouragement I need to keep going with IF. I think we can get stuck in a rut when we start gaining a lot of weight back, and it becomes hard to get back into the routine.

Electrolytes recommendations Netherlands,"Hello everyone,

I have been intermittent fasting (20/4) for weeks now and after reading a book (Fast like a girl) I wanted to work up to longer fasts and eventually do a 5 day long water fast.

Went to the doctor this morning.  The nurse told me she had to get a smaller BP cuff!  The doc was thrilled with my progress.  Repeated cholesterol labs to see if losing ‚Äúso much weight‚Äù made a difference.  And it did!   I‚Äôm back in normal range on everything!!

Is this ok? Metabolic wise will it cause any issues ?  Since I feel great , even doing lots of exercise , not seeing the downside .

Grief and IF,"TW: DEATH OF A LOVED ONE

Rather than having lost my appetite, I am ravenous. My body feels heavy and exhausted and seems to constantly want to refuel ‚Äî particularly with carbs. I‚Äôm trying to give myself grace, but I don‚Äôt want to fall into the trap of emotional eating or to undo the progress I‚Äôve made thus far and in terms of my weight and relationship to food.

First step of the journey,"In 18 months I managed to put on 32kg. My career changed from active to sedentary. My daily calorie intake became uncapped and untracked - having takeout 2-3x a week with many junk binges. I was drinking & snorting cocaine every weekend. Exercise became a past time for me. My mental health was declining rapidly. 

6 months ago I took the decision to quit alcohol and drugs. It wasn't easy, but over the past few months I've managed to land a job promotion, get healthier relationships with friends and family, my mental health is beconing much more consistent and more money has been saved. 

In those 6 months, I started couch to 5k app, been on various hikes, started pilates and also started going the gym a tiny amount - those healthier habits are certainly forming. The one problem I have is emotional eating, the urge to binge at night mixed with my lack of discipline meant I've only managed to lose 3.5kg over the last 3 months of actively trying to lose weight. 

Now it's time to undo the 18months worth of neglect to my body by kicking my effort up a gear. Today was the day I started IF to further my progress. I've done it in the past with great success - the difference this time is my partying behaviour will not be disrupting my streaks, momentum and progress. 

For the first time in a while my mind has been quiet, content in knowing that I've started a journey which will make my goals become reality. 

CW: 104.5kg
GW: 85kg

Methods to reach my goals:

-18:6 and longer fasts 
- Calorie Deficit
- 3-5x Gym a week 
- 1-2x cardio per week (at least one run) 
- 1x Pilates session per week
- Aim towards 70k steps a week 
(this level of activity will be achieved methodically and slowly to prevent burnout) 


Hopefully the structure of IF will also help improve my discipline, focus and drive. Since its been years since I have done IF, I would really appreciate if people can share the benefits that they've personally felt when sticking with IF long-term.

Title: Intermittent Fasting: When Should I Eat If I'm Not Feeling Hungry?,"

Hey everyone,

I've been experimenting with intermittent fasting 16/8 and have a question that I hope some of you could shed some light on. So, here's the thing: I don't really feel hungry during my fasting window. The only time I start to feel hungry or get hunger cues is when I actually break my fast and start eating. I normally sleep around 12-1 am

For example, yesterday, I didn't eat until 2 p.m. because that's when I felt like I needed to eat, but I wasn't actually hungry. Today was the same story, but I didn't eat until 6 p.m. Again, no real hunger cues until I actually started eating.

Is this normal? Should I be eating at a certain time even if I don't feel hungry? Or should I just listen to my body and eat when I feel like it's time to eat, even if that means skipping the ""traditional"" meal times?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences.

Thanks!",16m7xdr,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16m7xdr/title_intermittent_fasting_when_should_i_eat_if/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-18 21:28:26
I just might do it,"Feels like I‚Äôve been trying to lose the same 15 pounds for YEARS. Now my wedding is three weeks away and as of this morning, I‚Äôm only 6.6 pounds away from my goal! I‚Äôm excited and it feels reachable for the first time in a very long time! I‚Äôm short and didn‚Äôt have a ton to lose in the first place so 5 pounds makes a significant difference in how my clothes fit, etc. I should add that I absolutely don‚Äôt think anyone *needs* to lose weight for their wedding, it‚Äôs just been the thought of a big event coming up that has been really helpful for my motivation! 

I mostly do 18/6. I think focusing on reducing glucose spikes has been really helpful for me - starting meals with veggies, taking ACV, and using my muscles somehow shortly after eating. I still drink a fair amount of alcohol üòë but that‚Äôs a conversation for another time, and I actually have been able to cut back recently!

"Are there any concerns with metabolism ""slowing down"" with such little eating?","Title.

Been on IF for about 6 weeks now, but I can't help but wonder if I'm causing my metabolism to slow down. OMAD and 2MAD seems like it could possible cause issues long-term as far as metabolism goes

Wouldn't the body just ""turn down"" your metabolism in response to the drastically reduced calorie intake? 

I can already tell my bowel movements are way way down ever since starting this. Previously I would go poop about once a day or once every other day (when I used to eat standard 3 meals a day and 2100-2500 calories). Now I only seem to poop twice a week with the IF regimen (1 or 2 meals a day, 1400-1500 calories)

Anyways, I was just wondering about this, if there is a ""correct"" way to do this without your metabolism slowing down it would be good to know for a newbie

...or is a slowing metabolism only a concern if you go, say, a few days without eating? I still eat every day, just fewer calories and usually only 1 or 2 meals a day (as per most of the ""before and after"" success story posts on here)",16m727w,8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16m727w/are_there_any_concerns_with_metabolism_slowing/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-18 20:55:27

Am i hurting my body by continuing OMAD on cardio heavy days?,"Hello everyone, im currently on week 3 or 4 (not rly sure when i started) and i lost +\_ 15lbs.

I noticed im very tolerant to hunger, or better yet, seeing the progress im making makes arguing against eating very easy.

I started with 18:6 then switched to OMAD.  
I don't track what or how much i eat but i try to eat at the same time every day.   
Lunch is at a cafeteria where you can choose from 2 courses, not a whole bunch but its cooked food and generally pretty tasty.  
It usually consist of some type vegetable soup/broth and some meat (pork/chicken, be it grilled or with sauce or in a stew) and some sides like potato, carrot, peas.

The portion size is normal and i feel satisfied for 6-8 hours before i start to hunger.

Im having a pretty cardio intensive training two times a week and up until now i used to have a 2nd meal on these days (18:6). Now im thinking to stick to OMAD on these days as well.  


Despite the fact that i feel great every day, i can't help but feel that i'm overdoing this fasting thing and depriving my body of what it needs to be healthy.  
Am i bombing my body too hard by sticking to OMAD on the heavy workout day?  
What are some signs i could maybe watch out for that indicate something going wrong?

Thoughts after my second week of intermittent fasting.,"Hi All!

As promised I am back with my week 2 update and it has been a fascinating experience. You can see my [week 1 update here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16ezz34/thoughts_after_my_first_week_of_intermittent/) 

**Structure:**

This is unchanged from last week. 

My goal is to lose weight.

My plan is to start fasting after my evening meal (usually between 7-9pm) and fast until 12.00 the next day. This gives an average fast window of 16 hours.

During my fasting window I drink water and black coffee. When I break the fast, I eat what I want and track my calories.

I weigh myself first thing in the morning and am tracking a weekly average.

As yet I have not taken a cheat day but intend to do so when the new routine beds in.

**Observations:**

My main takeaway this week is how much stress is an eating trigger for me. My amazing wife has been away enjoying a well deserved break with some friends leaving me as child-wrangler-in chief. The energy it takes to get them up, fed, the animals done, and the girls out of the door to school on my own in the morning has made sticking to my fast trickier than last week. 

Funny thing is, as soon as my children are at school the urge to eat fades and I am absolutely fine until midday. No doubt that the morning stress makes things harder. 

Also, I have noticed how long it takes my stomach to register food. It seems it can be up to an hour after breaking my fast until I register the food and feel satiated. This is way longer than the conventional wisdom of 15-20 min. 

This I think ties in with the fact that I am consuming a very large lunch as my first meal of the day, probably larger than I needed. When I try and scale it back to a more typical portion I have to keep myself occupied for up to an hour after eating for the urge to eat more to pass. 

I am going to focus on more mindful, slower eating to see if this helps. 

My sleep has been a bit more disrupted this week. I have had a couple of 5 am starts as I woke up early and can't get back to sleep due to hunger. 

The gentle downward trend for my weight continues and I have seen a 2lb drop on the scales so far. This is less than I would have hoped, but it feels a natural and sustainable process. 

There have also been NSV, I have lost a little girth around my stomach and arms. 

**Conclusion:**

I am excited for week three. 

Of all the benefits of fasting, the most surprising have been the insights it has given me in to my relationship with food. ""Hunger"" means a lot more than ""I need sustenance"" it seems. 

Trimming down the amount I eat in my eating window is the big challenge for the next seven days but there is a line to walk between aiding weight loss and making the fasting impossible to follow. 

One final bit of info, I am planning my first cheat day for this Friday. [Looking forwards to a good breakfast.](https://media.tenor.com/LirNnozCxscAAAAC/food-breakfast.gif)

First week done - yay!,"I've just finished my first week of IF and I am really pleased with how it has gone. 

For background, I am 38F, 5'8"", SW: 300lb, pre-diabetic and high cholesterol (both good and bad). I decided to try and start with 16:8, but actually I have done a mix of 20:4, OMAD and 19:5 because it just fell that way. I've not got a GW in mind as it feels so far away and unobtainable right now that I don't want to obsess over a number I won't have seen for 20+ years. 

I haven't changed much about what I eat yet, though I am trying to reduce my carbs. I've done keto in the past and enjoyed it but found the prep too much and unsustainable in the longer term, though I wonder if it might be easier with IF because there is less to prep. 

I'm drinking plenty of water, have come down 7lbs already, and trying to be sensible with what I am eating. I'm not counting calories as such, but popping some stuff into My Fitness Pal to check in and make sure I'm not going overboard. I will also look to reduce my carb intake soon (keto and I got on well previously, until the prep became unsustainable). 

I'm struggling to get an accurate TDEE as another poster recently put up, so I am going for around 1,500 cals at the moment and seeing how I feel. 

Does this all sound like a sensible way to start? Is there anything that I might be missing that I should include as good practice early on?",16lspxy,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16lspxy/first_week_done_yay/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-18 11:17:20

"36 of involuntary fasting ""reset"" my gut bacteria, IBS under control now (gross warning)","Background: 34 year old male. I had always been the skinny guy so I could get away with eating anything for the longest time. About five years ago I began to have really bad bowel movements. I think this was the poor diet finally catching up. It got to a point where I had to plan my day around my expected bathroom visits. I couldn't go on extended trips and generally felt really embarrassed about how long it took to shit and how it never felt that I actually completed. At some point someone recommended digestive enzymes which helped tremendously, however, if I didn't take the pill just once my symptoms immediately returned. 

Involuntary fast: Last week I ate something risky that had been sitting in my fridge for a few days. A couple hours later I began to feel nauseous, then later into the night the diarrhea began, and it did not stop. I barely got any sleep because every couple of hours I had to get up, sit on the toilet for a good 20-25 minutes then tried to fall asleep before I had to go again. The body aches soon followed, it seemed to traverse my body, starting with a headache, then my upper back, midsection, and finally my legs and feet. 

The following day was an improvement but still miserable. I had zero energy, only getting out of bed to use the restroom. In the evening I did consume a couple of electrolytes. This helped with energy. The second night was the last of it, low energy but symptoms had mostly subsided. 

Aftermath: The morning after I felt just fine. I was not hungry at all, but decided I should probably eat something. It's been about 10 days and my bowel movements have returned to the way they were five years prior. There has even been a couple of instances where after I finished, I wiped and there was nothing to wipe. It honestly feels weird not having to sit on the toilet for 15-20 minutes at a time.

Now I'm no doctor and I am certainly not giving medical advice here, but I do believe the combination of fasting and massive, unstoppable diarrhea did something positive to my digestive track. Basically I think it flushed out all of the nasty, harmful bacteria.",16loaum,187,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16loaum/36_of_involuntary_fasting_reset_my_gut_bacteria/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-18 06:56:40

Seeking advice from those in maintenance,"
For those who met their goal weight and have maintained, what did you change in order to stop losing and just maintain?  How did you find the proper calorie consumption in order to maintain?  I am not quite at goal weight but thought I would ask since I am only 10 pounds away.  I typically do 20:4/OMAD and a 24 hr fast weekly.  I change up my eating times and have occasional days where I may only do 18:6.  I do an occasional extended fast to help with some digestive issues.  My problem is that I find that apps that calculate my needed calorie intake have always been way off.  Even at my heaviest I didn‚Äôt consume the amount of calories they say I should be eating.  So I really don‚Äôt know how many to add back to my diet to maintain once I reach my goal weight.  Also, how much of a cushion did you give yourself for loss/gain?

"Hurt myself exercising, recovery lead to a backslide. Sticking to it and getting back in.","Hey all.

I'm kicking myself for going into this with half-measures and getting only partial success and myself hurt in the process.

Monitoring food intake and sticking to 16/8 got me 50 pounds down to my first plateau. Two months on the plateau got me motivated to add in exercises, low-impact because of damaged knees. Pushups lead to my trapezius locking solid, which took my out of most life activities for a while.

10 pounds came back during the recovery, and now I'm restarting my exercises with a workout buddy and more study of proper form.

Some success.,"Just experiencing some success. 21 pounds since July 5th. 38F/SW209/CW188/GW ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

It‚Äôs been an interesting journey since last year I starting trying to get passed diet talk towards more intuitive eating and just realizing I don‚Äôt have to be obsessed with food 24/7. And to work about my anti fat perspective towards fat acceptance.

While I still am on the same journey, I‚Äôm also working minimally to lose weight. I got sick of buying new crappy clothes because of the weight gain (which was 90% due to a medication). I don‚Äôt count cals, I haven‚Äôt been exercising, and I don‚Äôt worry about what I‚Äôm going to eat. I just fast until either 12-4 everyday and stop eating after dinner. I‚Äôve been amazed how consistent the results have been, and how easy it‚Äôs been to not snack in the evenings. I also stopped drinking last December since I was having digestive concerns, and now when I try to drink I feel sick ü§¢ (I feel like if I was still drinking it would be harder? Idk). I do try to make sure I have 2L of water daily (sparkling water) because I feel better.",16l50lg,257,8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16l50lg,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-17 16:24:03
9 months into IF,"SW: 185/190(?) CW: 156~ GW: about 135'ish F/61 5'4"".

Started this journey Dec 2022...and despite HUGE life change (beloved, my champion  for IF, passing - yes, I keep bringing this up, but there is a point), I've kept with it.

I do 16:8 most days, and due to work load, have touched on 20:4 once about every 2 weeks. I've NOT been totally strict...I've had cheat days but only lasting about a day.  I tend to eat pretty healthy, I do have my evening wine, strive to drink 1/2 my weight in H2O daily & have bullet coffee (coffee & a bit of butter/ghee...it's dirty).

Exercise - main form is getting 10K steps/daily, body weight workouts & mat pilates...breathing exercises as well (I smoke organic tobacco)...inhale 4 counts, hold 6 counts, exhale 8 counts.

Main take-aways: better sleep! Loser clothes (shopping spree anyone?!), increased energy.

Also, my point from above: Caretaking takes a toll on one, mentally, emotionally & physically.  Beloved was keen on me getting back to caring for myself as he was, ironically, actually getting better as far as tumors reducing. He was so into IF when I started that he did 90% of the reseach for me üíñ.  And he was proud of my progress.  And he did the meal planning based on his research üíñüíñ. IF has been a key component for me to muddle through being separated from my bestie, my love & husband. I  struck with it, not just for myself, but for him too...anything less would be a diservice to his support, encouragement & total acceptance.  And this community has been been such a great support...I thank you all & love you all beyond words.

It's not a taste issue - I drank black coffee for most of my teens and 20s. But since having a kid, I can do a day or two of black coffee but then I start getting terrible stomach pain.

I know that technically speaking, adding milk to coffee will break my fast, but I'm wondering if anyone has any alternatives or suggestions - or just encouragement. Will this just not work for me, or can I fudge a little in the mornings with a tbsp of skim and still see benefits?

"Doing Intermittent Fasting and Eating Healthy, but Still Hungry all time - What Am I Doing Wrong?"," 

# 

Hello everyone!

I've been on an intermittent fasting routine for a while now, and although I've been eating what I consider to be healthy and fulfilling foods, I found myself feeling hungry all day no matter what I ate. Any idea why? normally I eat between 2 and 10pm, today I started at 12 to 8pm

My Stats:

* **Total Calories Consumed**: 2100
* **Calorie Budget**: 2000
* **BMR**: 1900

What I Ate:

* **Carrots, Medium**: 150 grams, 62 cal
* **Chicken Breast, Skinless, Cooked**: 3 ounces, 140 cal
* **Dolsi Ice Cream (Diet)**: 110 cal
* **Greek Yogurt, Plain, Nonfat**: Individual portion, 180 cal
* **Mango**: 400 grams, 260 cal ( I coudn't resist and ate it all lol)
* **Pasta Salad with Chicken**: 400 grams, 408 cal
* **Rice, White, Basmati, Cooked**: 200 grams, 258 cal
* **Freekeh with Chicken Breast**: 250 grams, 350 cal

What I Drank:

* **Bear Brand Powdered Milk**: 3 tablespoons, 113 cal
* **Ayran Full Fat Yogurt**: 150 ml, 100 cal
* **Coffee-Mate Creamer**: 6 tablespoons, 120 cal
* 2.5 liters Water 0

(I want to go slow and gradual, deficit target is 500 cal as a cycle for 14km each day. The budget iseven above my BMR, so I'm puzzled as to why I'm still hungry. Is it the types of foods I'm eating? Or is there something I'm not aware of that might be causing this lingering hunger? I thought it was water but I drank a lot and I still got hungry. I'm craving sugar and fat right now lol

Question about changing times of fast,I do 18 hour fasting. But each day the time may be different. My standard eating time is 11-5. Some days I may change that up due to schedule. So some days i may start my eating around 11 and eat last at 6.

Can IF help with hair loss?,"So I found out that there's some medications that induce autophagy to cure, or at least mitigate, hair loss.

I‚Äôve looked online for answers, seems I‚Äôm not alone but no definitive answers either. Any theories what causes this?

Electrolyte confusion,"Ugh!
Upped my IF schedule from one 24hr fast per week to 36hr (last meal Thursday night and break the fast Saturday) per week. The added 12hrs has been a boon to my IF/weight/fitness goals. Up to today I‚Äôve been strict zero food with nothing but plain water, plain carbonated water, black coffee or green tea during the fast. 

What I had not considered (and I take full responsibility for this oversight on my part) was the electrolyte deficiency. I know‚Ä¶I should have known better. In my feeble defense, I truly didn‚Äôt feel anything super off whilst doing 24hr. But 36hrs is a whole other beast. The muscle cramps and spasms especially are no bueno. Never mind the other symptoms that come with it. 

So I did the google search and landed on Simply Primals‚Äô Waterfast electrolyte supplement but now I‚Äôm second guessing the purchase based on the ingredients. I see natural flavorings (beaver butt juice) and rebaudioside A (Stevia leaf extract) among the other ingredients, which makes me think this stuff could induce insulin and I won‚Äôt go into ketosis and see the fat loss I really am aiming for. (I am finally seeing some striations, definition and veins!) Drinking it, it has lemony flavor with a slight thick aftertaste. 

So I come to this page and those who are most likely way smarter/knowledgeable than myself on this stuff. 

What gives? Trying to stave off the cramps and other nasty side effects with the electrolyte deficiency whilst staying healthy and take full advantage of the IF benefits. 

Am I just out $30? Should I just be doing plain water with a pinch of sea salt? Then what about the potassium and magnesium?

Lots of questions. Apologies. Any insight is welcome.",16jjmkb,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16jjmkb/electrolyte_confusion/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-15 17:34:24

17/7 IF and protein intake,"I've been doing IF 17/7 for for almost 23 months, in a caloric deficit or maintenance. My goal of doing this was originally to burn fat, then for recomposition.

Alternatives to Coffee Creamer or Half & Half?,"Are there any alternatives to coffee creamer? I use Half & Half, no sugar. I try to drink it black but something about having that half and half take the edge off is what I need. I've seen some people say coconut milk powder, others some type of mushroom powder. Anyone using something that is low calorie to try to minimize disrupting my fast? Again, no sugar, just looking to lighten the color so it looks like what I'm used to and takes just a touch softer. The more natural, the better.

EDIT: Just to add a bit, I'm mainly doing 17/7 IF, some days its 16/8, some days I go even longer.

UPDATE: Tried Nut Pods, no way this can possibly fulfill the place of Half & Half. I used 2 tablespoons and it added some flavor, but gave the coffee a new edge that wasn't pleasant. To get it to the color of what 2 TBSP of Half & Half, I'd probably need 3-4+ TBSP worth and calorie wise I'm basically back to Half & Half.  I used Califia unsweetened creamer in the past with decent results. I may try that or a few of the other suggestions here, or, just stick to Half & Half.

Wildly varying TDEE calculators,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been doing ADF for 4 months now. Weight loss has slowed but I haven‚Äôt been too concerned because of my age and because there‚Äôs still a downward trend with both measuring tape and scale.

They went all the way down to 2,200 cal, and all the way up to 3,000 cal. Insane. 

Part of this is, I think, the vague definition of exercise. Most have a ‚Äúlight‚Äù, ‚Äúmedium‚Äù, and ‚Äúactive‚Äù classification for how many times a week you exercise, but no mention of time or intensity for each session. So what gives?

To those who feel that you've lost the game.,"Hello once again everybody!

Around a week ago, I made post on ""what do you do, when you're ill?"".

After my week of getting better and decidedly getting ""off"" from my IF schedule (16:8), I had taken a step back when I stepped on to the scale.. +2,5kg ( +5.5lbs). A small number considering my scope and my starting weight ( 139.4 kg/307.3lbs), yet I felt devastated.. I knew that I was in a better condition in regards to the cold/fever I had, but that didn't make me feel even slightly better. I was (mentaly) down. 

I weigh myself every Friday first thing in the morning and that Friday, without any drama or doubt made a simple yet very, very effective decision: I just started again.

""woohoo... That's what you are supposed to do"". Yeah you're right, but I think I'm not the only one who get's discouraged by setbacks and ""failures"". 

""But it's a part of a journey"". This is very true, yet the timing could be bad for you if you've made progress and then your car breaks down. There is the feeling of uncertainty that set's in and it's logically understandable, since you can't ever be sure if that was it. Is it easier to walk back to the start line since it's the shorter trip and probably: even easier. Since after all, you didn't get that far from the get go. Doing the rest of the way on foot seems to take forever..

We'll I decided to fix the so called car.

Now, after not doing anything out of the normal (in regards to my IF plan) I'm back on track.

This morning I stepped on the scale once again. My initial thoughts before stepping on that scale we're: ""I've probably stayed on the same number as last week, and that would be fine since at least I wasn't going to be heavier, hopefully"".

The scale gave me my answer: 133.4kg (294 lbs).

Not only had I not gained anything, but I had went down 3.5kg (7.7lbs).

I could not be happier!

Now I've finally understood and internalized the meaning of a journey. I knew what it ment before, but I had not understood it. 

So to EVERY ONE of YOU: YOU CAN DO THIS! YOU ARE NOT ONLY THE ""SCORE"" YOU GET WITH EACH WEIGH IN, YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. YOU CAN PUSH IT, YOU CAN MAKE IT. I, AND ALL OF US IN HERE BELIEVE IN: YOU! 

Thanks again to everybody here that have helped me and who have given your support to a guy like me who didn't believe in himself after all the backfires and all the ups and downs. 

This truly is a journey, The BEST journey and I'm so thankful that I can share it with you all.

Take care and all the love!",16j3tz1,63,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16j3tz1/to_those_who_feel_that_youve_lost_the_game/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-15 04:42:11

"First meal post fast, blood sugar spike, then crash, then spike again?","Last meal was 19 hours ago.

6pm: fasted blood sugar, post exercise, so its a little raised from the exercise: 5.6 mmol/l

Note that my usual, rested fasting blood sugar is 5.3 mmol/l - when I've been exercising, it is a little higher than this.

6.25pm: 1st meal today - beef, cauliflower cheese, carrots and potato - about 1k calories total

7.45pm: Post meal blood sugar 4.1 mmol/L

8.45pm: Post meal blood sugar 5.9 mmol/L

I can't find anything online about this. My blood sugar appears to have taken a significant post meal drop at 1 hour 20 minutes after eating. The next measurement, an hour later, shows it has came back up again. I've never heard of a post meal spike, crash, then spike again. Does anyone understand this? Measurements are within the normal range.

I feel normal. No tiredness, no crashy feeling. Felt a little full maybe after the meal, had a lot of cauliflower. Didn't really get that breathlessness feeling i've reported on in a previous post. I had been trying to eat more carbs, and eat more often, and this was causing me to feel breathless post meal. But that seems to be improving now that I'm doing IF again, with carbs reduced back down to about 120g-140g per day. I tried increasing to 250-300g a day but it was really messing me up.

"Noob here, how do you all get back on track?","Hi All, 

I've been doing 16:8 intermittent fasting for about a month now and I'm really liking it.  

My eating window is about 9am - 5pm.  Sometimes on social occasions I'll make exceptions and I'll eat a bit later, maybe 6 or 7pm.  My question is, what's the best strategy to get back on track after I make an exception.

For example: If I have dinner with friends on a friday night and end my eating at 7pm, shall I start the fasting at that time and start the eating window on saturday at 11am, and then shorten my eating window to end at 5pm again? Or is there a better strategy to go about this?

*Side note: When starting, I had one or two nights in which I was quite hungry after my eating window, but after that first few days, those feelings went away.  It was pleasantly surprising how quickly the hunger goes away and I got accustomed to the fasting window.*

NEW TO INTERMITTENT FASTING! TIPS NEEDED.,"I'll start my intermittent fasting journey from 19th September.

I'll use these 3-4 days to have lower calories in the evening before completely eliminating them. 

My goal is to stay at maintenance calories (Calories required to maintain your body weight). By no means I am doing this to reduce my body weight, Body fat? Yes. Muscle Mass? No.

My current weight is around 93 kgs and I would like to stay at the same weight for months to come. (Aiming for Body Recomposition).

I will try the following diet for 30 days and will see how it affects my body. My feeding window will be from 5:30 in the morning to 1:30 in the afternoon.  (Following a 16/8 Split, 16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating.)

Also, I go to gym at 6AM for 1.5 hours of workout. 

I will try to hit a protein target of 180 grams/day and sleep target of 7 hours. 

I will do this diet all while avoiding junk food, caffeine and sugar.

I plan of continuing it if I am able to achieve my goal of body recomposition.  


What should I take into consideration? Any advice will be appreciated!",16ijxeg,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16ijxeg/new_to_intermittent_fasting_tips_needed/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-14 14:28:09
How to get back into fasting?,"I used to do intermittent fasting and lost a bit of weight and felt good. 

Then I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and lost weight due to being so unwell. I also suffered a trauma and have had mental health issues since. This has been going on almost 5 years.

Due to my illness I have been placed on biological medications and have had to use steroids. This has made me gain so much weight and develop bad eating habits.

It also doesn‚Äôt help my illness causes me extreme fatigue and I eat for energy bursts and when at work to keep going. I also comfort eat when I‚Äôm anxious.

Recently have halved my working hours to allow me to get my life sorted.

My life revolves around food. When I wake up, first thing I want to do is eat, and not just eat but eat something sweet.

Then I spend the day looking forward to my meals that are upcoming. 

I snack all the time. My weight went from 11st 8 (which was still very overweight for my height) to 13st 9 !!!!!!

Coming off of biologics is not possible but I now only have IV steroids during infusions every 8 weeks and I really want to get my curves back. My waist has disappeared and I just look like an Apple.

I'm planning to start a 72-hour sole water fast this Sunday night at 8pm and will end it on Wednesday evening at 8pm. I have experience with fasting and have completed 60-hour fasts before, but this will be my first 72-hour fast. I'm looking for advice on how to break the fast safely and effectively.

Would it make sense to stretch the fast to the next morning? If not, what types of food would be best to consume that evening before going to bed?

How Do You Eat Enough Calories?,"I'm doing a combination of OMAD and alternate day fasting where I basically one meal every other day and make it as large as I can, calorically speaking. However, on the days I eat I cannot seem to get enough calories into my body to compensate for the days I'm fasting without eating junk. I usually make it to the neighborhood of 2,250 kilocalories to 2,750 kilocalories, sometimes pushing to 3,000. But it's rare I get that high.

Over the past week, I've been averaging under 1,200 kilocalories a day. Even eating ad libatum on my eating days. That's like saying I've been eating 2,400 kilocalories every other day, which is probably about right. That's too low for me. So my question is, how do I plow more food down my gullet? I need to be averaging somewhere closer to 1,500 kilocalories a day, including fasting days. And that's still a 900+ kilocalorie deficit based the rate of my weight loss and my calories tracked over the past few months (TDEE ~ 2,430

EDIT: Please stop suggesting that I eat more fat. I'm eating 50-60% fat, 30-35% protein, and only about 10% from carbs.

Difference in how men treat me.,"Ever since I (F29) lost significant weight thanks to IF! I noticed how people treat me has changed especially men. Not that it matters but I noticed a drastic change.

I was at the coffee shop the other day and the barista gave me a free coffee I thought it was random and didn‚Äôt think much of it. I went to an ice cream shop and the man behind the counter insisted I try every flavour before I picked a flavour and gave me an extra scoop. Btw it was delicious.

Talking with a Nutritionist tomorrow,"I have been doing IF (18-6) for about 20 months now and love it.  However I want to do a longer 2 or 3 day fast now and move towards more and longer fasting.

She is not part of the IA community and will probably be suspicious and hostile to any concept of fasting.    What I want is more structure in what I eat, to keep it balanced and feed my microbiome and get all the stuff I need.  And keep on doing IF of course.  What would be the best approach you think ?

Just started IF about a week ago and I have a question about exercise - I'm confused by the responses I find online so I'd love to hear this community's feedback.,"My eating window is 12 noon to 8pm, but more often I have been having a lunch smoothie (spinach, banana, oats, protein powder) around 12.30 or even 1, and often I have finished dinner with the kids by 7. So my 16:8 is more like a 17:7 or an 18:6. 

Some nights, I play tennis late, around 8/9 pm, and I feel fine. On some mornings (not the ones after a tennis night, mind you), I do Zone 2 on my elliptical for about 60 mins. The machine says I burn about 600 cal but I don't know how accurate that is.

My question is about that zone 2 exercise. I do that around 5.30 in the morning and then I don't eat until 12.30 or so. Is this okay? It is good, like I hope, or is this unhealthy or even dangerous?

Does anyone else get bored of fasting?,"I've (27F) been doing IF for 4/5 months now, lost about 11lb (Im not too disheartened by this although my end goal is to lose another 60lb)

I try to keep it varied as I read somewhere not to let your body become too used to the fasting times but Im still sometimes feeling fed up of waiting for my eating window and denying myself the cravings. I know this is my binge eating and comfort eating past self fighting back plus probably some hormones while due my period but does anyone else have these feelings too?

"A month in, no weight loss. What should I change?","Hello, I started IF mid-August, mostly for weight loss purposes. I‚Äôm 40yo, 164 cm, starting weight 60 kilos, target 54 kilos. I am fairly sedentary (WFH, a little child, no family nearby so I can‚Äôt really sneak out to go to the gym) - I only do 10,000 steps twice per week. 

My eating window is 1pm to 8pm and only allows myself tea / coffee / water (no milk, creamer etc) during fast. 

I eat relatively clean. Definitely not keto, but whole grains, lots of eggs / fish, cheese, veggies and fruit. An ice cream once a week. No alcohol or soda or over processed food. I definitely wake up hungry in the morning. 

I do get some benefits of IF - sleep is great, better focus, clear skin. But no movement on the scale. I‚Äôve lost hardly a kilo‚Ä¶ on the good days. 

Can it take some time for weight loss to kick in, or do I just need to fast longer / eat even less?

Feeling exhausted after breaking my fast,"I am doing 16: 8 most of the time and sometimes will stretch it out to 18:6, mostly because I forget that my eating window is opening. I have two meals within my eating window. I don't snack between them. 
When I have my first meal, it's usually something like a small sandwich with cheese, butter, meat, vegetables on the bread, and sometimes a piece of fruit and an ounce of nuts if I still feel hungry.
Other times, it is something with more protein such as 4 ounces of chicken and some cooked vegetables left over from dinner. 
So no matter what I have for my first meal, lately I have had to lie down because I feel just exhausted. I don't feel exhausted before eating. I hate drink water with electrolytes in it and I don't have a ton of coffee.

Why was I not enlightened about IF earlier?!?,"I‚Äôm a 52 year old male.  I was in fantastic shape in my 20‚Äôs and then over the years, my weight fluctuated, but steadily increased the past 25 years.  

I‚Äôve had a few health issues the last 10 years.  I had chronic myeloid leukemia, but it‚Äôs been undetectable for the last 7 years. So while that‚Äôs no longer a scare, my weight has caused other issues - hypertension, scary blood tests associated with my liver, and so many aches and pains (including plantar fasciitis), making exercise a royal pain in the ass. I‚Äôve been feeling like crap for a long time. Well, my last blood test (checking for leukemia and other issues), I noticed my blood sugar was through the roof. Two months ago, I found out that I now have type 2 diabetes.

I immediately knew that enough was enough.  I have a 7 year old son who I love with all my heart and I want to be around for him! I started eating sensibly and decided to try intermittent fasting (16:8).  It‚Äôs been nearly 2 months and I‚Äôve only broken my fast a little early several times (I‚Äôm mostly 16-18 hrs).  I have never once broken my fast with any of those late night snacks that was part of my ‚Äúprevious life.‚Äù It‚Äôs like a game and I refuse to break my streak.  Within the first 3 days of IF, cutting out the crap I typically ate and replacing it with more plant-based foods, my energy levels increased immensely.  I was able to exercise.  Swelling and overall inflammation decreased.  My plantar fasciitis was manageable. And the weight is shedding!

Almost two months ago (July 20th), I started at my all-time worst, at 333 lbs. (6‚Äô2‚Äù) and I‚Äôm now down to 298 lbs.  I‚Äôm all in now.  I feel great! My blood pressure is down and doc needed to lower my meds (one day I‚Äôm gonna be off of them!).  My blood sugar is down, but that still needs to get better.  While I‚Äôm not a complete vegetarian, I‚Äôm now trying to go mostly plant-based.  

I‚Äôm thrilled that IF is working for me and it appears to be completely sustainable, unlike gimmicky and complicated diet plans. I‚Äôm just a little pissed at myself that I didn‚Äôt do it earlier.  I had no idea how easy it is and how well my body would respond to it.

I now have goals that never in my wildest dreams, did I think would be attainable. But I have a new-found confidence in myself, and I believe I will succeed.",16h9tie,255,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16h9tie/why_was_i_not_enlightened_about_if_earlier/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-13 01:41:34

Seeking Advice for my Wife who has Hyperthyroidism,"Hi!

My (32) Wife (F33) and I have been doing 16:8 IF since 3 weeks. Last year december we both decided to go vegan and about two months ago we allowed cheese back into our lives. Just the lifestyle change had me lose 12kgs (26lbs) naturally, without any regard to when or what I eat, other than it being vegan. 

Since I started IF 3 weeks ago, I've lost another 6kgs (13lbs), so it's working really well for me! I'm 1,97m (6,4) tall and weighed 142kgs (313lbs) in December 2022, right now I'm at 124kgs (273lbs)

My Wife is 1,76m (5,7) tall and she weighed 111kgs (244lbs) in December. She hasn't had the same progress since going vegan/vegetarian or starting IF. Now she weighs 109kgs (240lbs) so not even IF has done anything for her in the past 3 weeks. She is understandably frustrated, that I'm having such an easy time and she is seemingly completely stuck. 

I have to add- we make sure to have a fairly decent diet. We cook fresh daily, lots of vegetables and almost no dairy or meat replacement products. Very seldomly Soda, no sugar in the coffee and generally lots of water. I don't really see that she's doing anything differently than me. 

She was diagnosed with hashimoto, so an auto-immune disease with hyperthyroidism about 2.5 years ago during the pregnancy of our child. Since then she's been getting Euthyrox for her disease. 

Has anyone got any experiences with IF, diet and generally losing weight and Hyperthyroidism. 

She has her next appointment with the internal specialist in November and she'll definetly bring it up with her. We are also thinking of seeking the help of a dietician. 

Would greatly appreciate and advice you can give! Thank you :)",16h0dc1,9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16h0dc1/seeking_advice_for_my_wife_who_has_hyperthyroidism/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-12 19:21:07

Connection between IF and blood sugar,"i started at 12 hours (about 8 years ago) back then i weighted around 75kg and it went to to 65kg. But last year i change it to 18 hours. The reason why i increased my IF was because i had an ACL. Doc said it would be better I'm ""lighter"" as it will put less strain on my knees. Although 18 hours is rare, but the 12 hours is always a hit. For the past 9 days, i've been going more than 18 hours. I've stopped timing myself but rather just eat whenever i'm hungry. So its just usually one meal per day but i do drink water the whole time.

My only problem now is i get sleepy even if i have more than enough sleep the prior day. I'm thinking that maybe my blood sugar is too low? If this is true, then how do you overcome this? Would love to hear your thoughts.

If it matters, I'm 165cm. Small built, most of the excess weight is around my belly, neck and face. My waist has gone from 37 to 32.

Number of Days to get back on track,"I have been doing 20:4 intermittent fasting for since the beginning of August........ Football season hits. I spend 6 hours in a bar drinking a few beers and watching 2 games last Saturday. I tracked all the calories and stuff during the day. Not good, but really no too bad...... however, my will power went to shit. After 2 days of no will power and eating 24x7, I am finally back on track......

I am working on an approach to get through football season.... Any ideas? Other than, don't go out and watch football games?

Thomas DeLauer: 17 Cardinal Rules for Fat Loss with Intermittent Fasting,"Hey all, I was a little confused from some of the points Thomas listed and talked about in this latest video of his and was hoping to clear up some of the confusion. 

Let me stary by saying is that I'm an avid follower of Thomas and his work and how I got introduced to IF. 

Some of the points I don't understand are:

1. Fast less frequently than more frequently - for example, of the 7 days of the week, he says you should be fasting for a max of 3 days and then obviously not fasting the other 4. I thought I've heard him say in the past to fast no more than 3-5 days of the week, but now he's saying no more than 3. For me at least, fasting Monday to Friday was perfect, and then I wouldn't fast on the weekends, but still eat in a calorie deficit. So what's wrong exactly with going 5 days max and not 3?

2. Eat more on the days you don't fast - So here he says on his non-fasting days, he actually eats in a slight deficit (who knows how much of a calorie surplus that would be) and then on fasting days in a drastic deficit. To me, it just seems a little risky in the sense that you may not be in a net calorie deficit by the end of the week. You'd really have to make sure you calorie tracking is on point if you're gonna eat in a slight surplus 4 days of the week but deficit for the 3 other. Not saying it can't be done, but I just don't understand the benefit here besides what Thomas says is to keep the metabolism elevated. 

3. Take 2-week breaks from fasting - He means this more as a diet break kind of thing, but he didn't mention how often you should do it and eat at mantience or better. If I eat at mantience for 2 weeks, how am I gonna lose fat? Maybe I'm wildly missing something here, but that's what I understood. 

Again, not trying to bash Thomas here or saying that he's wrong on any of these, just trying to clear up my confusion around these 3 points. If anyone here happens to have done any of the 3, please feel free to share your experiences below. 

Thanks!",16gq2o2,1,2,https://youtu.be/vY5XprTjhgg?si=8Oe2oPlYR_lNJT5o,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-12 12:27:49

"I broke my fast early, but it‚Äôs ok!","I‚Äôm still very new to IF. I‚Äôve been doing it for a little over 3 weeks now, mostly pretty successfully. I don‚Äôt have a strict eating window as my days fluctuate greatly, the only thing I try to do is fit a daily fast minimum of 14 hours. Most of the time though I push it 16-18.

Anywho, last night when I woke up, I felt what I considered a ravenous hunger. Usually the type of hunger when I finally hit around the 15-16 hr mark into my fast, but it has been only 10 hours. I tried sipping on some water and whatnot, but I couldn‚Äôt overcome it and had a bit of a snack of epic proportions (I‚Äôll spare any triggering details).

At first this greatly upset me. I was doing so well, about 21 days of ‚Äúperfect adherence‚Äù. I lost about 9-10 pounds, I was on top of the world and I ruined it!

I did some reflection about it this morning though, and I figured it‚Äôs not the end of the world. After deliberation, I‚Äôve concluded that the only thing that happened was that my eating window opened early and will be extended by 4 hours for today. I am going to eat normally when I am hungry and just close again when I get to around a usual time I try to close my eating window.

I am not a failure. We are not failures. I got this. We got this.

I made a free fitness app for those who struggle to follow workout programs,"For nearly ten years, I've been committed to pushing my limits and improving my strength and endurance. My biggest takeaway? A well-planned workout routine is key. Whether you're browsing through r/fitness or r/WorkoutRoutines, it's clear that everyone values a solid workout program, and many free ones are available.

However, there's a catch - these programs are often in spreadsheets or PDFs. That's not exactly user-friendly, especially when you're trying to navigate a workout at the gym on your smartphone. I've even tested apps like Strong, but they lack features such as adaptable exercise progressions and weight tracking.

That's when I decided, enough was enough. Together with a colleague, I embarked on a journey to create a solution - FitXtreme. Our goal? Make top-notch challenging workouts easily accessible, so users can build a fitness routine and achieve their goals. We wanted to create a central hub for all workouts.

We collaborated with a UX designer to ensure a user-friendly app interface and began digitizing popular free workout programs. And the best part? You don't need any equipment.

Benefits of going 20:4 over 16:8?,"Hello everyone, a little bit about myself, 31m. 5'6"" 178lbs. Been trying to lose weight and get in shape over the last 2 years with no real plan or structure. Started going to the gym and whilst it did improve my life quite a bit, i didn't manage to lose a single lb, stuck at 187lb for the past 5 years.  
Unintentionally i started doing what i later learned was IF.   
I started by having lunch and dinner at the same time every day while also heavily cutting dinner portion size. Then i learned there's a name for this and there are some other aspects i can consider to make it more efficient.  
Now i'm down 9lb on day 8 of my IF and it feels like cheating.

Been mostly doing 18:6 but i can easily manage 20:4 and i even had a 36h fast over the weekend.  
Immediate benefits:  
I feel very good about the progress i'm making (which probably leads to the rest of these positive feelings)  
More energy during the day + i don't feel like passing out after lunch   
Better gym performance (and no more weird gastric reflux when the cardio gets intense).  
Better sleep at night (i go to bed more tired and fall asleep easier).  
Pants are way more comfortable lol.

Cons: The longer i go without food, the less i want to eat food. It got to the point i had to ""force"" myself to have a meal on the weekend just so i don't nuke my body with too much IF from the start.  


I have a few questions if any of you are so kind:  


What are the risks of going hard on IF and how do i know if im missing something in my diet?   
Maybe some suggestions of healthy foods you guys eat (not recipes).

In theory, is OMAD more efficient for losing weight than 18:6 or 20:4 provided i would eat the same amount of food in one sitting as opposed to two meals?

Is this weight loss linear (in theory) or will there be plateaus where i have to change things up?

Thanks and happy fasting :D

Reconciling ADF and exercise‚Äîbetter to work out on fasting days or off days?,"I've been doing a form of ADF for nearly a month now - I fast on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, eat normally on off days.

So far it's been going great. It took some getting used to, but I barely feel hungry on fasting days. I really don't want to screw this up.

That said, I need to start exercising again. I've just moved back to my hometown and I was having trouble finding a gym. I just found one that's affordable and near my apartment.

Thing is, I'm scared that if I start exercising again, it's going to mess with my appetite and I'll find it harder to stick to the fasting routine.

Has anybody been through this? Is it better to exercise on fasting days or off days? I work 9-5 and I'm useless in the mornings, so I could only go to the gym at night or on weekends.

Thanks in advance.",16fwosd,7,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16fwosd/reconciling_adf_and_exercisebetter_to_work_out_on/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-11 14:26:34
Fasting Windows / Late Dinner?,"So, I'm looking to start fasting 16:8 but I'm concerned because my fianc√© and I sometimes have to work late, past 6pm eastern time, and most days we aren't eating dinner until 8 or even 9pm. I was watching a video from Mindy Pelz about optimizing our fasts to be starting to fast 2 hours before sunset because our melatonin will be higher at that time and we will be less insulin resistant/more fat burning zone. 

So, If I eat at 8pm and then fast from 9pm-1pm (16 hours), will I still be burning fat? Or because I have to eat later, I'll not be able get into a 'good' fast? I'm looking to lose at least 35lbs before my wedding in June of next year. Would love to hear some of your fasting windows to see if I'm just overthinking this whole thing! ",16fgcy6,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16fgcy6/fasting_windows_late_dinner/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-11 00:10:29
I have been following IF and lower carb dieting around a year or two. Having breathlessness after breaking the fast 8 hours earlier with a very high sugar meal. Help?,"I've  noticed this breathlessness previously, but less severe, even when  eating during my feeding window. I always just assumed it was my stomach  being a bit too full from sometimes eating a lot at once. Although I  generally stick to low carb and calorie restriction for my weight loss  goals, there have been cheat days where sometimes I'll consume a lot of  sugar from chocolate, ice cream and coke - foods i'd never normally eat.  I'll often feel breathlessness after eating this way, though I don't  eat this way very often, so it didn't happen much.

Something  really caught my attention lately. I stopped fasting, stopped dieting. I  wanted to increase carbs and eat earlier in the day. Instead of eating  through the evening, I shifted my eating 8 hours earlier, starting with a  600 calorie breakfast.

I made  that breakfast often be pancakes or oatmeal, covered in honey, often  with a banana. It's not the kind of meal I'd normally eat. It's low in  protein and fat, and extremely high in sugar. I try not to over do it  with the honey, but I think I often end up using too much. This means my  raw sugar intake in this meal is probably extremely high, paired with  very low protein and fat. So that's probably a huge amount of sugar  getting absorbed very quickly. I'd also normally be fasting at this  time, without any complaint from my body, so my body is 'tuned' I guess,  not to expect any food at this time.

Shortly  after having this meal, I have the most intense bouts of  breathlessness, and this typically lasts for around 3-4 hours. I now  know it's not my stomach being over full, because it was a smaller meal.

I've  had an ECG, they couldn't find anything wrong, blood pressure is good,  heart rate is typically about 50. I'm also experiencing intense  insomnia, which seems to have came on after I tried to stop my IF  routine and switch back to a regular meal pattern. The insomnia  intensified when I tried to resolve it, by upping my carbs and sugar  intake, in case low serotonin was the cause, but this has only made my  insomnia worse, and is leading to daily breathlessness.

I  wonder if, because I've trained my body to accept lower carb, with  higher fats and protein, as well as not expect food throughout the day,  that suddenly eating an extremely high sugar meal, especially during my  normal fasting period, is causing dysfunction? Either this, or there is  something actually wrong with me.

Anyone  have any ideas about this or experienced anything like it? I've been  looking into high blood sugar and breathlessness, as there seems to be a  clear link between having very high sugar meals and the onset of  breathlessness. I'm not diabetic, but I've ordered a blood glucose  monitor so I can check what's happening. Today I'm fasting again, as before, and my breathing is fine.",16ftleh,7,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16ftleh/i_have_been_following_if_and_lower_carb_dieting/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-11 12:07:26

How to deal with hunger in the morning,"Hi! Just started doing 16:8 intermittent fasting two weeks ago. I‚Äôm down 11lbs.

Routine vs constant change,"I (F33) have been incorporating IF into my life for about 6 months now with the goals of increasing insulin sensitivity and losing weight for overall health benefits. In these past 6 months, I've mostly stuck to 16:8 or 20:4 cycles as they fit best with my work schedule. Having recently read ""Fast Like a Girl"", I understand that doing the same thing all the time might not make sense in the context of a menstrual cycle. However, everything I had previously read about forming habits told me that consistency was key - get up at the same time, go to bed at the same time, eat at at the same time, etc. As I understood, this mattered not only in habit formation but also just keeping your body within its circadian rhythm - so it releases cortisol, adrenaline, etc. at the right times to wake you up and melatonin to get you to sleep. And food is a major part of that cycle. So constantly changing up your feeding cycle seems weird. I'm trying to wrap my head around two things that make sense on their own (1. Change your feeding cycle with your menstrual cycle and 2. Maintain a constant feeding cycle for a stable circadian rhythm) but contradict each other. What am I missing or misinterpreting?

17/7 + strength training,"In the past I‚Äôve used intermittent fasting, both for how it makes me feel and as a means of restricting calories and therefore managing my weight.

I‚Äôve also started strength training (Olympic lifting) in place of CrossFit which I was generally following before. I train in the mornings so my normal routine now is to train fasted and to eat after that. If i were able to remove that meal after training and eat a bigger lunch I think I‚Äôd be in a good place.

Thoughts after my first week of intermittent fasting.,"Hi all! My first post here and I just want to say thank you to you all. This community has been a great resource while figuring it all out. I also listened to a lot of ""Six Miles To Supper"" who has a refreshing approach. 

Below is my goal, process, and observations of my first week - would love any comments or feedback. 

**Structure**:

My goal is to lose weight. 

My plan is to start fasting after my evening meal (usually between 7-9pm) and fast until 12.00 the next day. This gives an average fast window of 16 hours. 

During my fasting window I drink water and black coffee. When I break the fast, I eat what I want and track my calories. 

I weigh myself first thing in the morning and am tracking a weekly average. 

As yet I have not taken a cheat day but intend to do so when the new routine beds in. 

**Observations**:

The first week has been genuinely surprising. 

The actual fasting has not been the challenge I thought it was going to be. I would not say it has been easy, but easier than expected. Rather than a diet where there is a grey area over if or what I should eat, with fasting you just don‚Äôt eat. The simplicity is liberating. 

Sitting with my family as they have breakfast and I have a coffee has not bothered me at all. 

It has been interesting that a lot of the ‚Äúhungers‚Äù I experience when fasting are not from a lack of food. Stress appears to be a big eating trigger for me. Also tiredness. It has definitely made me more aware of what is genuine hunger and what is emotional hunger.

I do tend to get hungry around 10am, but a large glass of water and a coffee tides me over to 12.00.

Keeping physically busy helps get through the hunger rather than sitting around.

The first couple of days I *binged* when I broke my fast to a crazy extent. Well over 1000 calories in my meal. I have rained that in the last couple of days to 5-600 calories. It usually takes my body about 15 mins after I have finished the meal to register it so I keep busy for that time and then I feel great. 

Food tastes way better. 

There is a very pleasant ‚Äúfood high‚Äù after the first meal when you break the fast. 

Booze is a tricky one. I am not a big drinker but I noticed on the 2 nights I did have a couple of glasses of wine that I was hungry the next day - I assume that is the sugar content.

Also, my wife pointed out I used to drink a can of diet coke a day. I have not had any all week and this was not deliberate, I just didn‚Äôt fancy it. 

Had a couple of nights where I have woken up 5-6 am due to hunger but on the whole slept well. 

According to Fitbit, my resting heart rate has dropped a little and my sleep score has also dropped a little. 

Overall I actually feel great! Far better than when on a typical calorie restricted diet. 

**Conclusion**:

It has brought my relationship with food into sharp relief. It is proof I no longer need to fear hunger, also it has really highlighted that a lot of what I thought was hunger wasn‚Äôt! 

This feels good and sustainable. 

I have seen a gentle downward trend of the scales but the real test will be when I compare this weeks average with next weeks average. 

So far so good, looking forwards to week 2!",16ezz34,38,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16ezz34/thoughts_after_my_first_week_of_intermittent/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-10 13:12:16

My highest was 302 lbs. Fasting has kept me on top of my snacking and calorie intake. After a month of fasting I added exercise to my routine, I have been going to the gym 3x a week and taking 30 min walks after work 5x a week. Just last week I added some light jogging to my walks and I‚Äôm timing my miles to see what progress I‚Äôm making :) I‚Äôm consuming less than 2143 calories a day and definitely eating better foods. It‚Äôs insane how your appetite shrinks! The times I‚Äôve caved and had some secret binging I couldn‚Äôt eat the two items I order without getting full after the first one. I sometimes miss my fat girl ways but it was never healthy and nothing beats the feeling of being properly fed and feeling like the T-shirt‚Äôs I always wear outside look comically baggy. Just last week I bought two new tops a size smaller than I use to be comfortable buying and they fit so nicely! It feels really good to wear a well fitted shirt and not feel like the worse parts of me are showing. I can‚Äôt wait to see see what more this journey will bring.

Another lil update‚Äî big progress,"Stats= 20 year old male (almost 21) 
Weighed 375 at my heaviest but got down to 175 at my lightest
December/January I was always 247.5lbs+ 
From January to august it wasn‚Äôt as visible but definitely visible. 
But from that picture in august (which was taken on the 11th of august) To now
That‚Äôs a big difference 

Went from 215 to 202.5 in a month ish 

This is all a result of the combination of fasting, proper nutrition, and intense structured exercise 
Backed with bloodwork to make sure I wasn‚Äôt fucking my hormones or blood lipids beyond the ranges of homeostasis. 

The pharmakinetic aspect of fasting and what it does to the human body is FASCINATING to me.
And I think everyone would benefit from learning about it and becoming more aware of the processes they‚Äôre attempting to utilize.

Just keep going

Lower Blood Pressure after a longer (40h) fast?,"39m, 6 months ago my BP was very high.  Like consistently 150+/90+ high.   Also was like 100-ish lbs overweight.

Had eaten too much in September and really want to hit my weight loss goal this month (almost under 300 lbs) so I decided to try a longer fast (roughly 40 hour, Thurs night to Sat late morning).  

Was worried what this might do to my BP so a few hours after eating today I took it (multiple times) and I was getting 117/78 consistently.   At best I've been within about 10 points of this at any point in my journey.    Wondering if fasting is known to lower BP and if these affects will stick around?  What's other people's experience with BP and fasting?

I have done intermittent fasting in the past but this is my first time really buckling down and looking to take it seriously.

Good times were had but I‚Äôm definitely not going to let this continue through the weekend and looking to hop right back on to my routine. I don‚Äôt regret enjoying my night but I also know that I have a tendency to fall off the wagon pretty easily.

My question is, I have this urge to try for a 24 hour fast today as though that would help me get back on track rather than just eating again in my usual window. 

Is there any merit or reason to do a longer fast after an excess caloric night to help ‚Äúreset‚Äù your body back to comfortably fasting?

My Glucose Monitor Experiment,"I have a new toy: a Contour Next Blood Glucose Monitor. I'm not diabetic but since I've been back on low carb/keto and serious intermittent fasting, I really want to understand how my body responds to what I eat. I've only had it since yesterday but I've tested numerous times... again, just because I 'm curious about my blood glucose. 

Here is the most interesting thing I've found so far: my glucose was 84 before bulletproof coffee (I consumed nothing other than black coffee that day). Thirty minutes after BPC (which I hated, by the way), my glucose was 72. That's pretty amazing. BPC actually made my glucose go down! Just so you know, a healthy fasting glucose is between 70 and 100, so I'm well within a good range.

For lunch, I had baked ham (attached fat and all!), Italian sausage, and saut√©ed onions. My glucose before was 74 and 30 minutes after it was 76... again how is this possible? I dunno but I am enjoying this new information.

I have a few other tests I will do, like how apple cider vinegar impacts glucose. I've read that if you drink ACV 30 minutes before you eat a carb-heavy  meal, your blood sugar won't spike quite as high. I'm not going to rush into this one, because I'm still afraid of carbs, but this is on my list.

Just thought I'd share... In case you are wondering, the cost was less than $20 for the monitor and less than $20 for 35 testing strips. Oh yeah, and it has an app so it logs my readings automatically via Bluetooth and is compatible with Apple Health.

I only started calorie and macro counting around 2 weeks ago because my weight loss plateaued.

I'm struggling to achieve the recommended amount of calories to achieve weight loss. These calories are automatically adjusted depending on how much exercise I've done that day.

I'm worried that I will struggle to lose weight and my body will retain weight to compensate for a ""lack of food."" I struggle to eat bigger meals and my weight problem was due to eating poor quality rather than quantity.

IF and tattoo healing : an experiment,"Hi,
Im about to embark on an experiment and thought you would enjoy reading about it. Ideas are welcome if you think something can be easily improved.

TLDR : im gonna try and see if IF can help my new tattoo heal faster than the previous one, as a mice experiment suggested.

TW : I will be discussing skin wounds and skin healing.


Context :
I read this study ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25881054/ )
where mice were made to fast, then got a skin wound (sorry mice), and then fasting mice were compared to the control ones and voila, wounds healed faster.
As I was about to get a new tat, I wanted to test it out on myself.
The mice fasting protocol was 4 days every two weeks, for two months. There was no way I was doing that so I went with my usual 17/7, but on the week leading to the tattoo (current week), I've added two 20h+ fasts (21 and 24 respectively). I've been doing IF for 4 months.

My control : im usually a fast healer when it comes to skin. My previous tattoo lost its last scabs and had its definitive appearance after 10 to 11 days.


Limits : 
Loads! My control is a past event, the time of year and temperatures are very different (last time it was december), my protocol is actually not similar to that of the mice experiment, a tattoo isnt the same as a biopsy punch wound, and most of all, im the only subject. 
To be clear, im aware this isnt scientific at all, and no matter the results, it wont be meaningful as anything else than an anecdote.

Tattoo is tomorrow (saturday) at noon (GMT+2). Ill come back and edit the post with results/observations as I get them. Feel free to ask questions and/or suggest stuff!


Edit 1 :
So im now at H+9.
On the whole I've felt better than last time, I wasnt knackered when I left, even though the session was longer, and the skin is less sensitive to touch right now.

Edit 2 :
Roughly H+34
First night and day were easy, it's a bit tender under the warm water when i shower but beside that it's all good. Last time was way sorer (is that a word?) during the first day.
Ive put on healing lotion for the first time tonight. I had zero ink bleed last night, ill see if the lotion opens the gates (it usually does, but not a ton either, scabs are usually where i lose the most ink).

Edit 3 : 
H+45
The bright black look is fading so healing is happening ! Still no ink bleed. Soreness is unchanged. I have to wear real clothes again and I cycled to work morning. No major pain but i certainly feel my chinos on the thigh tat.
The scabing is minimal so far and im a bit perplexed about that. I usually scab BIG and then it goes away fast with minimal scaring. Im nearing the 48h mark and still no big one. Nothing is red or puffy so i dont think it's a bad sign but still.

Edit 4:
Three days (minus a few hours) in.
Still no ink bleed or big scab. Minimal scabbing is going on. I honestly dont know if that is better, worse, or just different than my usual healing pattern. 
Last time it took three days for the itchiness to start, so if im operating on the same schedule it means today is the day. 
Lines are still raised (mostly on the hip, the thigh zone is much smoother) and soreness when touched is still at the same level. Even whith 12h+ between skin lotion applications, skin doesnt feel dry or tight.

Edit 5 : roughly 15h after edit 4
Itching DID start today, oh boy, also all soreness disappeared during the day. Scabing is definitely happening to the naked eye, even though those scabs are quite pliable and soft.

Edit 6 : 4 days and a few hours
Itching is awful. One of the pieces has started some dead skin shedding in the shower. The whole thing currently looks awful so healing is going along as expected. So far I would say my healing schedule is similar if not identical to last time.

Edit 7 : 5 day and a few hours
SO MUCH dead skin, either flaking away or about to. So much. I wont ever have skin ever again.

Edit 8 : same day after a shower
Okay one of the main zones (hip) is nearly all peeled off, it's the one I mentioned has started peeling on day 4. Colour is much better and oh the blessed non-itchiness. The other main zone (thigh) is, id say, 40% done. Weirdly enough, it's the smallest zone, the little touch up the artist did on my previous tattoo (other hip) that not only is flaking off yet or even has itched much so far. 
Anyways im really relieved im nearly done with the worst part.

Edit 9 : 10 days and a few hours in
Nearly all (if not really all) the flaking off/peeling off is done. Colour is consistant with previous tattoos, skin doesn't it nor feel sore anymore, all seems well. That being said, the bigger lines are still shiny and slightly raised, suggesting all healing isn't actually done. This is quite different from previous tattoo, that was entirely settled by day 9-10.

"If you have a period, the scale is a liar","I just wanted to send out a little encouragement to those that experience periods, and are on a weightloss journey. When I first started someone posted something similar on Reddit and I found it soooo encouraging. I‚Äôve been doing 16:8 with CICO. 


From the 22nd August to 2nd September (11 days) I had steady decreases, or at least the scale was moving down on average.


However as soon as I hit the 3rd of September my weight spiked up 500g (1.12 pounds) and did not drop until the 6th of September where I suddenly ‚Äúlost‚Äù 850g in one night (1.874 pounds). Now it‚Äôs physically impossible to lose that much overnight except through release of water retention and bloating.


While that might not seem a huge number of days to wait, in reality it is enough to feel like derailing because you can‚Äôt see the progress. It is also not uncommon for me to not see any weight loss for the entire period from ovulation to menstruation and then suddenly drop a kilo overnight from bloating.


So all this to say, keep on pushing through, be encouraged, see out the month to determine true progress and perhaps consider tracking your cycle phases to see any patterns that may occur.",16crdsc,109,29,https://i.redd.it/ws0ved0okwmb1.jpg,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-07 21:38:50

IF anywhere from 16-20 hrs with a MORNING eating window which I truly believe was the game changer for me. I have done IF in the past with a later window and never had this much consistent success. I finish eating for the day around noon to 2 pm depending on when I start and when I get my calories in. I eat around 1500 a day give or take, I try to fluctuate it (that has adjusted here and there when I was in more of a deficit and weighed more obviously), very little exercise aside from being a mom to my 6 kids, and the occasional home light weights, yoga, walking etc. I eat lower carb but NOT keto, I will have real bread and potatoes and sugar all the carby stuff as long as I can fit it into my lower carb macros (about 80 net now). My baby is 9.5 months old now, I am breastfeeding and my milk supply has never been better! I have started to dirty fast this last month of maintenance, but I have noticed I have been more hungry at night when I hadn‚Äôt been for months. Thinking of either upping my daytime calories and dirty fasting and seeing what happens, or going back to a clean fast.

Tell me about your experiences :)

What makes you fall off the wagon?,"I recently did, after three months of fasting and IF. I‚Äôm back now for the third day in a row. I thought it could be interesting to reflect on what makes us fall off the wagon when we do.. and how it unfolds and how we get back to it.

For me, it was just an extra stressful day with the kids.. nothing major. That was it. So I got stressed and I started stress-eating. One day.

But there is something addictive about using food in an emotional way. It‚Äôs not necessarily the food itself bc during IF, I was able to have whatever as a meal and it didn‚Äôt make me crave more. I was in a different place in my consciousness. 

But the idea that energy comes from food.. that seems to have been what caused it for me. 

So that was all that was needed to make me fall off the wagon for a week. I immediately felt worse in my body again, fatigue, low energy, aches, stress.

I calmed down my system, the way I go through my day, enough to finally get back on three days ago. I‚Äôm starting to feel a bit better again. I feel that I need to manage my stress levels. Outside of a proper retreat, when life continues around you as usual, it can be challenging at times.

IF + Macros,"Hi All,

I‚Äôve been doing 16:8 IF since July 2023. The first month my weight dropped about 7lbs pretty fast. However, afterwards, it fluctuated from 8-10lbs loss. I joined IF because I was completely against counting calories as I felt it wasn‚Äôt sustainable.

I figured that my weight was fluctuating due to my monthly cycle but it didn‚Äôt quite drop back to where it was days after it ended and so this made me feel like I was doing something wrong. 

Aside from doing IF, I exercise 5-6 times per week (4 days strength/weightlifting & 2-3 days cycling). I was also eating very healthy and focused more on protein, healthy fats, and low carb. My sugar intake was very minimal as well (I.e. my coffee creamer, fruit, and occasional gum). 

Albeit, after not seeing my weight loss progress the way I was hoping I figured that I was probably overeating - regardless of how much I thought I wasn‚Äôt. So I bit the bullet and started using MyFitnessPal app again. I decided to go the route of counting macros so I purchased their premium version.

Tracking my eating revealed that I was actually under eating. At the end of each day I usually have 500+ calories available to use. And although this would be great for mere CICO, I‚Äôve been trying to meet my Macro requirements but it‚Äôs been a real struggle. 

I actually have no problem hitting my protein goal. But in the last hour of my eating window I struggle  to find food items that fulfill the fat and (mostly) carb requirements. I‚Äôve even stretched my window out a whole hour beyond my desired fasting start time to try and fit more food in my stomach. This literally makes me feel very stuffed and uncomfortable.

So I guess my question is, how important is it to hit every Macro? I‚Äôve been deficient in my carb intake by nearly 100grams on a few days. However, I‚Äôm usually w/in a good range on protein and fat (because I can always use MCT oil to supplement this requirement).

My goal is to lose fat and tone up.",16b9agv,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16b9agv/if_macros/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-06 03:25:01

Some things in IF seem like another extreme diet,"I‚Äôm a beginner, and am learning from IF books, groups and podcasts - and the information is starting to feel extreme. (Example: don‚Äôt drink anything with flavor, no fruit herbal teas).  The logic is it can increase blood sugar even though there are no calories.  What seems to be missing in the bigger picture is: *Why can't it be a practical simple kind-hearted approach in tiny steps?* such as start with 12/12 (then celebrate!), then 14/10 (then celebrate!), then 16/8.  Instead, what is communicated is if you don‚Äôt do 16/8 first (with ONLY black coffee), you can‚Äôt lose weight. Why stress over cream in coffee in the beginning? Isn‚Äôt it better to have fasted 12 hours and drank coffee/cream, than having done nothing at all? Some language in IF encouages people to obssess over tiny things - And emphasize following celebrity authors, some with questionable science. It feels like a repeat of diet culture. It shouldn‚Äôt have to be this complicated.  Forgive - I know I sound harsh, that is not my intention.

My SW: 220lbs, CW: 190lbs. GW: 175lbs. height 5-10

But the reason I am posting this: my blood test results! 

1. My A1C was 6.4 which is in borderline diabetic range.
2. My liver tests: AST and ALT was off the charts with severe case of fatty liver disease, so much so that my doctor recommended me to do liver scan to check for scar tissues and liver damage.
3. My cholesterol, particularly triglyceride was off the charts with very low HDL and high LDL.
4. Had frequent gout attacks due to high uric acid.
5. mild hypertension with BP 90-130 range.

So I was on path to start diabetes, blood pressure, liver and cholesterol medicine and doctor already prescribed me those.  But later somehow I stumbled upon and this sub and knew a friend who got miraculous results from IF which motivated me to start on this journey.

Now, to me its nothing sort of miraculous cure all, mother of all medicine!!  My test results, BP are all normal, no more gout attacks. I read somewhere autophagy helps with cancer prevention as well but not sure without 24hr+ fast I can trigger autophagy or not.

 On a plus side I save on groceries, snacks etc and not  constantly worrying about what to eat next! 

Seriously, I cannot fathom why entire nation not doing this or why doctors are not actively prescribing this.

Back on the IF wagon after the holiday weekend,"Male 53 | SW 204 | CW 196 | GW 185. It's been about six weeks of intermittent fasting 16/8 (8pm-12pm). I typically give myself one weekend cheat day where I have breakfast with the kids around 8 am. I also have a beer or bourbon with dinner, but I still start my fasting window at 8pm. This past Labor Day weekend, I allowed myself to have breakfast Fri/Sat/Sun/Mon, as well as dinner past 8 pm, except for Monday night when I started my fasting window at 8pm, as usual. I also did two Orange Theory morning workouts on an empty stomach over the weekend, so that helped. 

I weighed myself this morning, and I thought I would've gained a couple of pounds. I was actually the same. Now, I'm back on IF for the week, and we'll see how things go.

Will This Work?,"Hello! I'm kind of new to IF, but I've heard a lot of good things about it and I'm trying to get into it. I struggle with my weight, and traditional diets are hard for me because I'm a big foodie--I love ""soul food"" and don't like the idea of eating salads all the time.

Right now, I've jumped into doing the 36:12 fast, where I basically eat normally one day and then nothing the next. The only issue is my coffee addiction. I need caffeine every day, but I hate black coffee with a passion. I have a latte machine at home, and always make myself an Almond Milk latte in the morning. Overall, it's about 200 calories or so, no more than 300 if I make it really big. The Almond Milk is super low cal, and the only thing that adds any calories at all is flavoring syrup. Now, this added sugar does make me hungrier, but I've been able to resist temptation anyway. So it really has worked in that regard, and on my fast days, I look forward to that one cup of coffee in the morning.

Is it okay if I have lattes during the fast days, as long as that is the ONLY calories I consume during the day? I know I won't lose weight as quickly as if I didn't, but I'm okay with that. I just want to know whether I will still lose weight by eating normally one day and then severely restricting calories to 200 every other day.

"Working on 23:1, I was hoping for some pointers. And I wanted to verify some information so I can progress","I(afab31) regretfully reached 200 pounds. 

SOME INFORMATION: I was heartbroken. This time last year I was 167 and I was successful in my Noom experience. I got a new job, one that was an office gig, more pay and stuff. The cost? I wasn‚Äôt as physical, and I was unable to purchase the same dietary items I was using. So I gained all the weight back and then some. 


I‚Äôve already started 23:1 by simply just eating once a day. My goal is/was regardless of what I ate, just once. I‚Äôve since gotten to the point where when I do eat more than once a day it‚Äôs usually because I‚Äôm so stressed that I cave. I‚Äôve held to once a day for over two months now. 


With that said, I just wanted to verify some information.


I was told that I can‚Äôt drink anything but water or anything with sugar. Is this true? I‚Äôve been careful to drink mostly tea, sometimes I go about unsweet, or low sugar, and I do drink sweetened teas throughout the day along with water. Am I suppose to stop drinking sugar completely?


I‚Äôve gotten to the point of eating once a day, and to be clear I have been controlling my portions throughout this some days are easier than others, but going forward what would be a good caloric cap? Or do I even need one? Do I simply eat until I satisfied?


Are their certain foods outside of sugar(my other question will basically cover sugar) I should avoid?

"""so uhhhh, where's the poop?"" (digestion question)","Title.

So I've been on this diet for a little over a month now (started Aug 01), and I can't help but notice I only take a poop like once every 3-4 days now... and when I do poop it doesn't seem like a lot of poop comes out? ü§®

Before when I was eating ""normally"" or the standard American 3 meals a day I remember I was pretty regular in the bathroom. Pooping every day or every other day - and plenty of decently sized turds would come out

Suddenly ever since doing a mix of OMAD and 20:4 seems like all the poop ""mysteriously disappeared"" lol

Anyways, I assume this is just a standard side-effect of this IF diet, since less food going in = less ""material"" to make poop out of, but I figured I would run this by you guys so maybe we can compare & contrast notes

For my PCOS/Thyroid sisterd - 16lb in a month,"I (29F 217SW) have autoimmune thyroid disease for years and end of July, I was 'lucky' enough to be diagnosed with PCOS.

Losing weight has always been really tough for me and finally this year I found out why - being insulin resistant together with my very abnormal BMR (much lower metabolism than normal people)

From August 6th, I took out all my courage and started IF again, only this time, with the diet macro and supplements adviced for PCOS patients.

It has been incredibly hard but I managed to lose weight despite the difficulty. Within a month I have lost 16lbs and it gave me a lot of hope.

I wish a lot of people, especially ladies who have similar conditions, can keep going and thrive with your medical conditions that fucks up your weight and confidence.. I will keep trying with y'all.",169frd4,214,18,https://i.redd.it/fklsm7svh5mb1.png,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-04 02:35:13
Questions on 16:8 as a newbie,"I‚Äôm 18, 5ft8, weigh around 78kg and hope to at least lose 10kg. I usually eat a lot of snacks or random things throughout the day. I want to do 16:8 with just lunch and dinner. I have some questions.

Is this how 16:8 is usually done, two meals? 

Do I need to strictly focus on and control my calories consumed, considering I‚Äôll be cutting out completely all the junk food I‚Äôd normally eat anyway? 

Does the 16:8 time actually matter or can I just do two meals a day?

Should I also work to reduce the amount of food I eat at lunch and dinner?

Does the hunger go away after some time doing 16:8?

IF and PMS/weight gain/bloating?,"I‚Äôm only a week into IF.

Days Off?,"Hey all! I'm looking to do IF starting Tuesday 9/5 (just coming off a week of vacation and indulgence).   
I'm F/36/5'5"" CW 165lbs / GW 130lbs / BMI 32. Just wondering in general what everyone's ""schedule"" might look like? Do you take certain days off, weekends, do IF every single day? Also, do you all plan your workouts on certain days, or times of day? I know everyone's journey is different, but just curious how you all plan out your weeks/days?

 A little background on me: I've been trying CICO and workouts for over a year now and lost only 5 lbs, so I need something else! I work from home M-F and like to have a beer(White Claw) usually on Friday night, or Saturday. I know a bit about fat burning as I did full Keto for a full year back in 2016 and lost 35lbs, So I know alcohol is not a good idea as it's the first thing our body will try to burn before carbs and fat(Do I do myself a huge favor and just cut it out 100%? I'm thinking yes lol). Not looking to do Keto this time, but have been reading up on IF and it sounds like the fat loss process in our bodies is similar with autophagy and a certain state of ""ketosis"" to help with that ""switch"" to fat burning mode at 16 hours fasted. My fianc√© and I do our grocery shopping on Thursdays and usually will order take out that night for dinner while we are in town, but otherwise cook our own meals every other night. Meals typically include a protein, veggie and a carb so, pretty well balanced. I am rarely hungry in the morning, so a 16/8 or even 18/6 would be perfect for me to just have lunch and dinner. I know to also still stick to a calorie deficit still. I do love my coffee in the morning, but I also love my creamers, so I will need to experiment with going back to maybe a bulletproof variation or find some non insulin spiking sweetener(any suggestions there?). 

I also have Ulcerative Colitis and have been in a pretty bad flair for about a month (work stress and just terrible food choices) and I know that slowing and reducing my food input will help my symptoms a ton. My fianc√© and I are also going to be starting a family in the next year or so, so I'd like to get to my goal weight/healthier overall before becoming pregnant so I can have a healthy pregnancy(lower blood pressure, lower risk of complications etc.) Curious what time frames people have in terms of how long it took you to lose about 30lbs? (Don't come for me! Again; I know each person is very different but just a general idea in months is helpful to me to know if it's ""working"" or not and what I that I need to change something to fix it. I also know that measurements, clothes that don't fit, are a better indicator than scale weight, so I will be tracking that as well).  

Thank you all! Feel free to DM me if you have any other personal stories you think could be helpful!

How often do you monitor your weight?,"I‚Äôm 4 full weeks into the IF now. Pretty strict 18:6, mostly do 17-19h fasting. I admit I don‚Äôt do regular workouts and I don‚Äôt eat just diet food.

The thing is that my progress has been so slow compared to a lot of people I see here, even though they don‚Äôt workout or do any intense dieting. I lost about 5lbs at this point, and with me already being overweight, this is barely a progress.

Suddenly hungry/clean fast,"Background: I‚Äôll be 9 months post-partum on Weds. Started IF in May, easing in, and have averaged 20/4 or OMAD since July. I‚Äôve been on Team NoScale, but have been taking measurements which have reflected at change of at least 15 inches all over‚Äîlikely more as I didn‚Äôt start measuring until mid-June. My fasts prior to 3 days ago were not clean, I was having cream and a pinch of sugar in my large iced coffee. 

Last week I noticed that for the first time there‚Äôd been zero change in measurements. This happened to coincide with reading *Feast. Fast. Repeat*. I should also add that I‚Äôve previously read *The Obesity Code* and as a bioscience-oriented person, the science made a ton of sense, and validated my own anecdotal experiences. The two books taken together are an interesting juxtaposition in terms of attitudes towards ‚Äúdirty‚Äù vs. ‚Äúclean‚Äù fasting, and in general I tend towards a ‚Äúwhatever works for you‚Äù mindset. I think I‚Äôve secretly expected that eventually I‚Äôd have to go clean to keep shaving off the baby weight, and after no change in measurements at last measure, I believe that time has likely come. I plan to weigh after completing 28 days of clean fasting.

The issue/question: Today is day 4 of clean fasting and for the first time since basically starting IF, I feel incredibly hungry almost right away in the mornings. On Friday the hunger was so persistent even after two big black coffees that I broke fast at 17 hours where 20 has been my minimum for 2 months! Is this really all because of cutting out a little cream and a pinch of sugar, or might something else be going on? I have been eating a good amount of dried mango at night recently, but that‚Äôs not wholly unusual where early hunger definitely is. I was feeling really excited for potential changes that may come from clean fasting but so far the only change has been a significant increase in hunger signaling. Has anyone else experienced anything similar and if so, how long did it last? Suggestions on how to get through this adjustment period?

Warning: the Dangers of IF,"I‚Äôve been doing IF for 3 months now and I‚Äôm down 30lbs (M40, SW 250). I‚Äôm mostly doing OMAD, so I can have dinner with the family. It‚Äôs been truly amazing, life changing.

IF has enabled me to almost get back to my college weight, and it‚Äôs been relatively easy (after the first week of adjusting). But there‚Äôs a big draw back.

Today I went for a swim, and I haven‚Äôt been since I started IF. Was wearing my usual swim shorts, nothing to worry about.
Until I dove in the pool, and left the swim shorts behind. I forgot to tighten the shorts and because of the weight I lost, they just came off.

I like it and I am not finding it too hard, except I get waves of nausea in the late afternoon or evenings, during or after the eating window‚Äîand sometimes the nausea wakes me up at night. 

Right now it‚Äôs 3am and I woke up with massive nausea. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be hunger. Feels more like acid reflux or bile? 
Yesterday I also woke up super dizzy. Could it be a type of hypoglycemia? 
I fast between 8:30pm and 12:30pm. I get very hungry just before I break my fast but otherwise the hunger seems manageable. 

I am worried IF is messing something up with my liver or gall bladder? Is that a thing? I drink tons of water and herbal teas, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dehydration. 
I am usually a fairly good sleeper so not sure why I keep waking up at 3am or 5am on IF.

Hacks to get over the first few hours of fasting?,"So I love IF in general. Have tried up to 24 hours. When I‚Äôm fasting, I feel lighter and more clear headed. 

My problem is with the first few hours of a fast. My family and I have dinner together, it‚Äôs often the time I break my fast. It‚Äôs important that we have that time together as we don‚Äôt get a chance to eat together as a family at any other time. 

My problem is with the first few hours after that meal. I snack! Even if I set myself up as fasting using my tracking apps. I even write the time I‚Äôve started fasting on my hand with sharpie to remind myself not to eat anymore. But so often I cheat, eat something high carb or sweet and that can often become a bit of a binge. 

This is regardless of how big my main meal is, whether or not there‚Äôs carbs, or how much protein. I always have a huge amount of vegetables. 

Once I‚Äôve established the fast though (say by mid evening onwards), fasting is incredibly easy to stick to. So I‚Äôm confused, and would really love any advice.

Never thought I could survive without coffee & creamer!,"I started IF two weeks ago. I started on this journey b/c I‚Äôm a mom of two young boys and about 30 pounds overweight (5‚Äô2‚Äù)‚Ä¶ and I have been struggling to stay energetic and engaged in the way I want to and need to for my boys. I‚Äôm hoping this lifestyle will help me get control of my extra weight (most of its in the lower belly), help my digestive pain and intense bloating, as well as to help my energy levels. I‚Äôm also hypothyroid so that doesn‚Äôt help my lack of energy either!

As I mentioned I am only two weeks in, but one of the best changes I have noticed so far‚Ä¶ is how much easier mornings have been for me. I have been waking up with much less struggle - and lately even waking up before my boys do (which otherwise would have been unheard of for me). It used to take me about 45 mins just to get out of bed in the morning (constantly hitting snooze). 

Most of all, I never thought I could survive a day without my coffee and creamer. I would rely on it to function and look forward to it every morning; otherwise I would feel like a zombie! But since I break my fast at 11am now I have been finding I don‚Äôt crave coffee at that point anymore, and can continue the day with enough energy to not need it at all. That in and of itself is a miracle for me. 

I am currently doing 16:8. I‚Äôm hesitant to do intervals much longer than that because I want to keep this up and make sure it‚Äôs sustainable. I have had disorder eating in the past and I don‚Äôt want to get into extremes. I‚Äôve only lost about 3 pounds at this point, but as long as I can continue to feel this energetic I want to keep pushing through!

Feels like I'm eating too much even when I'm under a thousand calories?,"Just as the titled suggested, I'm doing OMAD with an eating window of an hour. Today, I mixed three eggs with a splash of milk, paired it with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, two pieces of bacon (45 calories each) a handful of onions and two handfuls of peppers and topped it with two slices of low fat cheese. 

I then put about 6 spoonfuls on my plate alongside some pancakes pieces (which all together came to about 700 calories.)

I ate, and immediately felt like I was full, way too full, even though I had barely touched my plate. 

I know I'm not eating too much because I've steadily been losing weight, and I know you're not supposed to eat under 1200 calories (I checked my TDEE and it said 1300 calories a day was enough for me to lose weight) but I can't help but feel like I'm eating way too much. 

Even the scrambled eggs, which I got off of keto, felt too much. I feel not only too full, but guilty as well, because it honestly feels like even during my window period, I'm using it as an excuse to overeat.

"""I must not snack"" (with apologies to Frank Herbert/Dune):","‚ÄúI must not snack. 

Snacking is the diet-killer. 

Snacking is the little-meal that brings weight-gain. 

I will face my hunger. 

I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 

And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Where the hunger has gone there will be nothing. 

Only I will remain.‚Äù

Trying to put a light-hearted spin on some of my personal IF experience; I'm sure this advice is not news to many of you.

I've been maintaining +/- 3 lbs. on 16:8 for the past couple of months, and far and away I find I do much, much better if I eat large, filling meals a couple of times a day and avoid snacking.

If I can eat to satiation, I find my calorie count by the end of the day is so much lower than if I try to graze periodically and never actually satisfy my hunger.

If I *do* get hungry between meals - keeping a big bottle of zero-calorie  flavoured electrolyte water kills the cravings 9 times out of 10.

That's all - just a little unsolicited anecdote from someone who has benefited greatly from this subreddit.

My goal is about 120, but I'm taking it slow and don't mind if it takes a while. I have so much more energy and am feeling great.

I did IF last year and lost about 20 to 30 lbs, but stopped and gained it all back plus some. I think I was too strict and burned myself out, plus I was going through some intense mental health stuff. Therapy and IF from a more balanced and relaxed perspective are awesome.

"Trying IF for the second time, down 7 pounds so far","Wasn't sure how to flare this. I gave intermittent fasting a go a while back when weight stopped coming off, but my appetite never adjusted and I was just hangry all the time, so I gave up. I think I did the 16:8 version of it before.

Now I'm giving it another go, but doing 5:2 (the Fast 800 Diet) and so far I'm not doing too bad! I'm learning to ignore the hunger on the lower-calorie days as well as trying to get the most bang for my buck when it comes to food choices on those days because I have to prioritize protein and fiber while minimizing calories. I've found a couple solid meal choices that keep me full for a decent chunk of the day, and when the weather gets cooler, I know I'll be drinking more hot tea too and that will help me feel full for a bit.

Thankfully my appetite seems to be adjusting slowly, either that or I'm just getting better at ignoring my stomach. I also notice I seem to not get as hungry on days when I eat more (I aim for 1400-1500 calories a day those other five days of the week), so I can eat less on my non-fasting days too.

I'm about seven pounds lighter than I was at this time last week, which I know is most likely water weight. But hey I'll take what I can get! It's not as easy as CICO, but it's doable. Hopefully I actually get some results from this because some of the weight I've lost over the past few years is slowly creeping back on and not coming back off.",167l3sp,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/167l3sp/trying_if_for_the_second_time_down_7_pounds_so_far/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-09-01 22:25:55

Would continuously raised insulin cause weight gain even if calories in don't exceed TDEE?,"So insulin is a fat storage hormone, right?

Does this mean that continuous ng tube feeding cause weight gain even if calories don't exceed TDEE?

I am talking about continuous ng feeding where a patient is fed a certain number of ml per hour for 20 hours with a 4 hour break at night.

Insulin is released every time we eat. Insulin causes the body to store glucose as fat and inhibits the body from burning fat stores. If you are being fed continuously by an ng tube, you are effectively continuously eating. So your body will be continually producing insulin. So it will just be storing fat.

E.g. a person might be fed 100 calories of ng feed per hour for 20 hours straight for 2000 calories in total. If their TDEE was 2000 calories a day, would this make them gain weight?

Their calories in wouldn't exceed their calories out, which would suggest that they wouldn't gain weight. But their body would be continuously producing insulin which promotes fat storage and this suggests that they would gain weight.

I ask because I'm currently in hospital on a continuous ng feed.",166f233,19,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/166f233/would_continuously_raised_insulin_cause_weight/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-31 15:59:48

How do I manage unsupportive family members?,"Hey Lovelies, I hope y‚Äôall are doing well. I‚Äôve been intermittent fasting for the past eight days and it‚Äôs surprisingly been going okay (black coffee and chicken broth have been incredibly helpful!). I have to lose about 50 lbs and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll relapse back into binge-eating. When I discuss this diet or my weight loss goal with my mom or grandma, they start complaining about my new lifestyle. They keep insisting that I should eat throughout the day instead. The problem though, is that eating schedule doesn‚Äôt work for me. They‚Äôve never had to lose a copious amount of weight and they‚Äôve never struggled with over-eating like I have. I reached out to my mom today because I was feeling scared that I would eventually give up this new lifestyle and not be able to lose 50 lbs. Instead of supporting me, she told me that I should go on a low-carb diet and go on the South Beach diet. It‚Äôs just frustrating because everyone has complained about my weight gain, but now that I‚Äôm losing weight these people are still unhappy.

Edit: I just wanted to add that when my family members complain about my weight gain or my choice to intermittent fast, it makes me really sad which then makes me want to binge-eat. I honestly would love to hear any advice that y‚Äôall have to keep going in the face of this type of criticism.",166cu5b,4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/166cu5b/how_do_i_manage_unsupportive_family_members/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-31 14:34:21
Golden paste - tumeric w IF,"Hello,
D
New to IF. Been reading a bunch of info and trying to determine what to do. 

About 2 months ago I started taking golden paste (tumeric, coconut oil, black pepper) a few times a day for joint inflammation and pain. About 1/4 tsp each time. It's worked wonders and I don't want to stop.

This week, I started IF. Easing in with a small fast (15:9 to start bc that works w my work/home schedule and once I'm in a routine I will go longer).

My question is: how much will 1 dose of golden paste mess up my fast. I usually take it in the morning with water?
I know we aren't supposed to do anything with calories but it would be hard for me to skip this one.
The hope is that w IF my inflammation decreases and I not longer need the golden paste! 

For reference, a batch of GP includes 1-1.5 cups of water, 1/2 c turmeric 1/3 cup coconut oil. 
I take 1/4 teaspoon 3x a day.

Thank you in advance!",166b8r2,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/166b8r2/golden_paste_tumeric_w_if/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-31 13:30:27

Specific food and snack cravings. I‚Äôm struggling right now. I want that cookie.,"I‚Äôm 3 weeks in and I think I‚Äôve already lost 2kg since starting 16:8 (SW73kg 5‚Äù3 F) and cutting out snacks completely but omg‚Ä¶ the cravings are so hard to beat. 

I use to snack ALL THE TIME. It‚Äôs ridiculous how much I ate. I think this was due to working from home, being comfortable, and having no self control. I‚Äôm mentally fine but I just got too comfortable with that lifestyle and only realised how unhealthy it was when my doctor weighed me and told me I was overweight. And since that dreaded appointment, I‚Äôve been so motivated to lose weight and be at a more healthier weight. 

First two weeks of IF were a breeze. I never use to exercise so now I‚Äôm committed to getting more steps in daily. Did some longer walks the second week, I was already feeling so much better. In my mind, my body‚Ä¶ just felt super happy and fit.

Then this week being my third. I could feel my old self creeping back and wanting more more more. I‚Äôve had specific cravings like chocolate chip cookies that I use to heat up in the oven and snack on as a dessert with hot tea at night. I know I don‚Äôt want to go back to that but sometimes like now, I think to myself ‚Äújust this once‚Äù but then the once turns to the second night and then eventually I‚Äôll be back to square one. 

Luckily I have a really supportive partner who isn‚Äôt doing IF but encourages me to eat better and will walk with me when he feels like it. He didn‚Äôt guilt me about the cookie craving but he put into perspective of what my day will look like tomorrow. He said ‚Äúif you eat this cookie now, you‚Äôll break your fast and you‚Äôll complain about not being able to sleep‚Äù And I responded ‚Äúwell I can try a one day meal tomorrow!‚Äù He then replied honestly and earnestly ‚ÄúNo. No you won‚Äôt and I know you‚Äôll want a second meal and I can‚Äôt force you to not eat so we will end up eating more‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I huffed and puffed knowing how right he was and I hated how well he knew me haha. A few minutes passed and now I‚Äôm having a hot bath, no longer hungry and just relaxing until bed time. 

But that damn cookie. It tastes so good lol.",1666tzd,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1666tzd/specific_food_and_snack_cravings_im_struggling/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-31 09:59:49
Insane libido after 36h fasting - scientific reason? discussion,"40M always low libido, ED problems, borderline low testosterone (not enough for Endo to start TRT).

Since starting a mix 18/6 IF (4xweek) + 36h long fasting (1xweek) I've noticed a huge improvement in libido and constant erections especially towards the end of the 36h fasting.

I'm trying to figure out possible reasons behind this so I can think how can I respond to my problems when in non-fasted states.

1- HGH gets boosted by up to 500% around the 48h fasting mark > It would lead to a LH rise? (my LH lab values are always borderline low)  
2- Antidepressive-like effect after cognitive enhancements? > Brings back sexual desire  
3- Lots of more hydration + added electrolytes while fasting > Body wasn't getting enough water before?

Modest progress chat,"Anyone else make modest progress and get a little discouraged seeing people who have lost way more weight than you? Let's get together here to encourage each other. I started 10 months ago at 5'6"" 287 lbs. My low weight was 254 in April through grieving a tragedy. I've regained some and now I'm 264 lbs. I did OMAD for around 7 months, it went fine in the beginning and I was shedding pounds fast then bingeing began to offset the weight loss. Due to bingeing I had to increase my window to 6 hours a day, which has gotten rid of the binging and weight gain and I'm now maintaining. Anyway, I've always done intermittent fasting for the health benefits beyond weight loss. Indeed, my c-reactive protein is cut in half, my body pain is gone, and my type-2 diabetes and PCOS are hugely improved.  I'd love to get down to 210 lbs, heck I'd settle for 230, and I hope I make it there some day. It's a learning process and I have to slowly learn what works for me.

!August Abs Check! + IF habits/lifestyle update,"(my pronouns are ze/zir/zirs, he/him/his, they/them/their)

Hello again, everyone! It's been some time since my last post.

Because of the heatwave in AZ rn [every time I visit family down here there's a heat wave! (‚Å†‚îõ‚Å†‚úß‚Å†–î‚Å†‚úß‚Å†)‚Å†)‚Å†‚îõ‚Å†ÂΩ°‚Å†‚îª‚Å†‚îÅ‚Å†‚îª ], it's been too hot for me to complete my usual work-outs; I've been sedentary this month. I've gotten in a few workouts (maybe 1-2 intense/moderate sessions a week), and I've stuck to short morning yoga sessions, but that's about it.

I more-or-less have kept to my IF routines. I've been lax with my eating windows, but my fasting times remain consistent. I also completed a 24+hr fast on Monday w/o noticing, because I was burned out from preparing my language lesson plans and meeting some development deadlines. So, I just stayed in bed. (My AuDHD burn-outs are more brutal during the summer, I swear! üôÉ)

I was also more lax with my diet. Cookies, pastries, ice cream, and pasta were getting some love from me this month (‚Å†Íèø‚Å†Ôπè‚Å†Íèø‚Å†;‚Å†)

Because this lack of activity and devil-may-care attitude towards my diet in August, I didn't think I made any progress. I honestly thought that I had back tracked. But today I took some selfies just to test my suspicions, and well... I'm pleasantly surpised that my abs are still showing! It was a confidence booster.

After 3 months, IF is back to being a habit that I don't much have to think about, so even when I'm not actively doing it I more or less stick to OMAD or two smaller meals + a snack (like cereal a couple hours before bed). Occasionally I'll go 1-3 days with 14hr or shorter fasting windows, but I always switch back within the week. I also now unconsciously stick with my fasting windows, and I no longer make a grab for a bunch of snacks when I'm stressed. 

I know my abs are the subject of today's post, but I've also noticed the definition in my shoulders, biceps, and pecs returning. I still have a relatively high body fat percentage for my taste (around 20-22%), but my BMI and weight are now back in the higher end of the ""normal"" range for my height, age and assigned sex, at least by western standards. My weight's new daily average is 70‚Äì72kg, as opposed to when I restarted IF in June when I averaged 76-78kg, with an estimated body fat percentage of 28-29%.

I felt a bit down this month because I haven't been as active as I would like, and thus felt behind in my progress. But, looking at these photos reminds me that I'm doing just fine! 

I'm looking forward to see what my progress will be at the end of 2023! ·ïô‚Å†(‚Å†Ôº†‚Å†¬∞‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†¬∞‚Å†Ôº†‚Å†)‚Å†·ïó",165q9pd,25,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/165q9pd,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-30 20:47:58

UPDATE - Mayo Clinic IF study is complete (for me)," UPDATE 

Original post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/141el3o/mayo\_clinic\_if\_study/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/141el3o/mayo_clinic_if_study/)

To recap, Mayo Clinic is conducting a study that compares IF results based on time of day. Volunteers were blindly put into one of two groups:

Group A can only eat between 8 AM and 4 PM 

Group B can only eat between noon and 8 PM.

Zero calorie drinks are the only thing allowed outside of those windows. During the study, we were not to introduce any other changes, like diet and / or exercise. Only the IF process was to be introduced. 

I was randomly assigned to Group B

The 12-week study has concluded (for me) and here are the results:

Number of times that I ate outside of the window during the 12-week study - 4

Starting weight ‚Äì 218lbs

Starting waist ‚Äì 112 cm

Starting BMI ‚Äì 27.9

Starting A1C ‚Äì 5.4

&#x200B;

Ending weight ‚Äì 212lbs (6 LB loss)

Ending waist ‚Äì 104 cm (8 cm loss)

Ending BMI ‚Äì 27.2 (.7 loss)

Ending A1C ‚Äì 5.4 (unchanged)

&#x200B;

When the entire study is complete, I will receive a letter in the mail sharing the study-level results. I will share that with all of you too unless it is forbidden. I'm expecting it to be public. 

There may be an interest in doing further studies that also introduce diet / exercise with IF. I‚Äôll participate if so. 

Moving to IF was not a hardship for me. In fact, I was surprised that I had any positive results at all.  Unlike other weight loss methods, I can still eat the things that I enjoy, I just have to be a little patient. So... I‚Äôm a convert! I plan to stick with IF but will alter the window to 10-6. I also plan on eating a little healthier too. 

Thank you all for the help and support. Now that I am not limited to the rules of the study, I will scout this sub for tips to improve results.

Excited.,"In addition to IF, I try to workout on my mini stepper at least 4 days a week (30-45mins). I drink a gallon of water a day. In the time I was gaining the ~30lbs, I completely stopped working out (abnormal for me), ate all of the things, and essentially stopped caring. Mental health played a role. Lots of positive progress has been made. Both physically and mentally. I don‚Äôt even recognize myself in the first pic lol wild.

Set point problem?,"
I‚Äôve noticed through years of losing and gaining weight that my body seems to really cling on for dear life when I get around 12 stone, and really puts up a fight going any lower no matter what I do. 

This time around my HW was 14.5 stone / 203lb (in May), the highest it has ever been CW is 11st 12.5. I have been doing really well and losing consistently 2-3lb on average a week since June. This week I have actually upped my exercise as I‚Äôve started doing Couch to 5k on top of what I was already doing, and my eating habits haven‚Äôt really changed this week (doing very low carb mixed with 16/8 IF), yet my weight has not budged for 7 days now. I have had marginally more carbs than usual but not significantly (29% for this week versus 25% last week, when I lost 3lb)

Wondering what I can do to help with this! Will it sort itself out eventually if I keep doing what I‚Äôm doing? Is there anything else I can try to kick start it? I had a bit of a cheat week around 2 weeks ago which I thought would help but it doesn‚Äôt seem to have‚Ä¶ Its so disheartening to be working so hard and not seeing any result, especially as I‚Äôve got used to losing really well each week.

Lessons I learned during a very long day (today),"I've been a lurker in intermittentfasting and fasting for 5 maybe more years, never actually commented. So today I was feeling very down, with a low will power, and absolutely feeling like eating my entire fridge - door and handles included - I've been on OMAD for about a month now. Thought about making a reddit post to get moral support, bot-mod-chan deleted my posts from both community since I didn't have enough karma. There I was cursing at my phones screen so I went ahead and actually commented post I had lurked on before, dropped positive comments that I had thought in my head but never actually shared, u know, in the posts themselves. To my surprise, the couple of comments I dropped around were really well taken and I felt like I made people happy, that made me incredibly happy. So I got up - I usually have dinner as my only meal - had lunch, met my calories and eat a bit of chocolate but I was feeling way better already (I guess I must have been actually hungry too). After that I continued with my daily routine, exercised and felt more energetic, I realized I perform better after having eaten, I know I won't be taken advantage of burning my very own fat while fasting, but I felt good. 
After all of these, I can now post in the community, realized I stand OMAD better when having my meal around past lunch time (4pm) and I'm truly thankful to be part of these amazing community that made me feel better even after being slapped in the face for not being able to post.

 I‚Äôm not new to the process, I‚Äôve been fasting in some form since about 2018-19. I started with 14 hour fasts and worked up to 16, and most recently I‚Äôve been doing 18 hour fasts no problem.

 I‚Äôm about 10 months postpartum now. I started 16h fasting again towards the end of March/start of April. In the past month I have been able to up it to 18 hours about 3/4 days a week (weekends aren‚Äôt really conducive to fasting for me.) 

I also go for 2 kilometre walks about 2-3 days a week with the stroller, live on the third floor of an apartment building with only stairs, and carry heavy bags up and down at least once or twice a week. I‚Äôm also carrying my 20 pound baby around several times a day. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol on a regular basis (like maybe once every month or two) and I don‚Äôt eat sweets very often either. In the mornings while I am still fasting, I have a cup of black coffee with maaaybe half a teaspoon of sugar in it. I eat all home cooked meals as I live in a town with no fast food, and every meal includes a protein, rice or pasta or potatoes, and lots of vegetables. I time my fasts with an app.

Before pregnancy, I weighed 160lbs. My height is 5‚Äô7‚Äù. Now I weigh 170lbs, sometimes fluctuating week to week from 167-8 back up to 170. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm very overweight, but I am trying to lose a few pounds.

25M / 260lbs / IF is not working for me.,"I used to be 300lbs in high school and started IF in 2015. I lost over 110lbs by 2016 using a 16:8 regimen.

Flash forward to 2023 and I'm 260lbs (was 300lbs in January). Before starting IF, I cut out soda, ate less often, and ate healthier. Now, I'm trying to incorporate IF into my lifestyle again and it isn't working.

My typical 16:8 consists of not eating past 6pm, start eating at 10am. I eat one normal meal, throughout the day (if I eat more than that, I gain weight). I'm eating homemade meals consisting of high proteins such as ground beef and chicken. I drink plenty of water throughout my day.

As of lately, I've noticed my weight is staying exactly the same. I've started working out again and thought maybe it was muscle weight, but I haven't gained more than 0.05% muscle mass.

ADF-36 Hour Fast Every 3rd Day?,"Hey all, 

I have been experimenting with various versions of IF since February 2023. I started with 16:8 with a twice monthly 36 or 40 hour fast.

Some tough situations in life arose (got fired from my job unexpectedly, couldn't get approved for unemployment insurance so I was broke as I used my savings to catch up on bills etc) so I stress ate during that time. 

I am now back to fasting but I want faster progress. I don't want to do keto or any kind of specialized eating plan, but I have made up a new ADF schedule and I have been doing it for a solid month.

For 2 days in a row, I have an 8-10 hour eating window (between 11am-7pm or i extend it to 8pm or 9 pm on occasion) and I enjoy 2 meals and a snack or dessert (not non-stop eating) then on the 3rd day, I completely abstain from food and it turns into a 36 to 40 hour fast. So 2 days of eating during a window followed by a full day/night extended fast where only water and black coffee is consumed.

My exercise for now is a lot of walking, bit of light cardio and some strength training, and I do it when I feel up to it.

I have been doing it for besrly a month and I am honestly feeling so good. This schedule has killed off any desire to binge or stress eat and I am so thankful.

My only thing is, I am so impatient and I always doubt myself when I try something new. 

My question is.....if I stick with this, will the calorie deficit caused by cutting our a 3rd of the days I normally eat be enough to trigger decent weight loss? I am 5'2"" and I am in the 190s. I want to lose about 60 lbs.

I'm doing OMAD but I can't stuff myself enough to get to my goal calorie intake,"I'm using Myfitnesspal to track calories.

I also did IF (4-6 hour window) with Keto around 3 years back, did that for a year and a half without problems. Got off the diet and gained a lot of weight after I stopped going to the gym.

Recently got into cycling and absolutely love it, I'm quite motivated again to lose weight since it'll make me faster on the bike if I do it right.

So I've been doing OMAD for about 3 days now, 4 PM is my mealtime and I'm struggling to even get to 1500 calories much less 1800 which is what Myfitnesspal recommends. I ate about 900 calories and was stuffed, I ate a bit more than half my meal and had to power through it.

Add in the fact that I do about an hour of indoor cycling on the trainer every day and I'm way below my calorie goal.

Do I force myself to eat more? I can always reach for some ice cream and eat a cup or two of it for some fast and easy calories but with the focus on losing weight, I hate the thought of even doing it.

I Can't Eat Like I Used To,"For reference:

- SW: 218 lbs (99 kg)
- CW: 196 lbs (89 kg)
- GW: 141 lbs (64 kg)
- Alternate Day Fasting
-  ~ 45 Days In

Intermittent fasting is crazy. I just broke a 40 hour fast with a 1.15 lb. (522 gram) delmonico ribeye steak with lots of butter and garlic, along with a literal pound of broccoli and I could not finish the steak. This wouldn't have even been an issue a few months ago. My stomach has obviously shrunken substantially and it seems like I cannot physically eat more than my TDEE in one go. Of what I could eat of the steak and broccoli, I only consumed 1,350 calories. And that's including all the butter! 

On top of that, in 45 days I have lost 22 lbs. or 10 kg. That's basically 0.5 lbs. or 0. 25 kg every single day. At this rate, I will be at my goal weight by spring. I haven't been able to lose this much weight this quickly, on purpose in a few years. This is awesome. Just wanted to share. 

I also had a quick question. When do you consider that your fast has begun? Do you consider it the moment you've stopped eating for the day? Or do you take gastric emptying and digestion into account so that your fast truly starts in the post-absorptive state? I'm wondering what the consensus is here since I've been doing the latter by subtracting about eight hours from when I finish eating.

"New to fasting, some questions","So I‚Äôm a 19 Male that started fasting last week to lose weight. (1,78cm 87kg starting and with a goal of 75kg for the moment).
I‚Äôve already done a week, doing 16:8 with 2 big meals to start and finish and usually a snack in the middle.
I know it‚Äôs probably not accurated but today I weighted 86.3, meaning I lost around 0.7 kg in this week.
Finally, for context, in my country we space a lot lunch and dinner (around 7 hours) and my family usually do more, but I‚Äôve been able to hit the 8hours max all week.

So here are the questions:
1) my 8hrs fasting may start 1 hour earlier or later than normal some days. I know it can make fasting of 17h or 15h. Does it have a big negative effect?

2) I should focus to do 2 big meals and avoid snacking in the middle right?

3) Soon I‚Äôll start Uni again, where I spent normally 7-8hrs. I‚Äôve been thinking but it will be hard to do 16:8 on uni days. Is it okay to do 14:10 on weekdays and go to 16:8 on weekend or will this have a negative effect on the fasting.

Thank you, I hope I get progress to show to this community in a few weeks/months.",1640kue,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1640kue/new_to_fasting_some_questions/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-28 22:41:35
Combining 5:2 method with 16:8,"Hey everyone,

So for context, the 5:2 method I understand to be 5 days of non-fasting normal eating, with 2 non-consecutive days of very limited eating (500 to 600 calories). The 16:8 method is a consistent fasting schedule of 16 hrs fasting, with an 8 hour eating window. From what I hear 16:8 is one of the more popular methods given how unobtrusive it is. 

I tend to eat quiet a bit of food and so while I want to do the 16:8 method, I like the idea of having 2 days of deeper fasting to make sure there is some consistent weight loss week after week. 

So I was thinking about combining them and doing 5 days of a normal 16:8 fast with 2 days of limited 500-600 calories eating.

Does anyone see any issues with doing a fast like this? Would it be pushing it too much? 

Generally I like the feeling of fasting because o have IBS and having little food on my stomach tends to lead to a more pleasure life experience for me lol.

Been doing 14/10 IF for 6 months,"I was one of, ahem, THOSE people who say that IF doesn't work. It's a gimmick. It doesn't work. It's a scam. 
I will admit now I was wrong. I started doing intermittent fasting last March. I weighed 165 (I didn't have much to lose). I fast from 9pm until 11am. I changed nothing about what I eat (carbs, sugar, fat protein all the same) and exercise exactly the same as before starting. I lost weight very slowly, I now weight about 152, which is my goal weight (it's not water weight loss, I weight at the same time every week).
I'm not sure how it works but it was a really easy and simple change and helped me reach my goal.

20/4 Meal!,"This chicken was amazing and so filling, so here is how I prepared it: 

I had the chicken breast soak in brine (just water with sea salt) in lukewarm water for 15 minutes on the counter (closed container). When it was done brining, I preheated the oven for 450 degrees. Then I got a pan and used avocado oil on it so the chicken wouldn't stick. I dried off the chicken from the brine and rinsed any excess salt from it. Then I put garlic, black pepper, and paprika on both sides of it, and rubbed it in. Cooked in oven for about 25 minutes, until internal temp was correct. (These chicken breasts were HUGE, it took a long time for them to cook even though it was at a very high heat. I bet medium or lower size chicken breasts only need 15-18 mins.) Side salad for fiber: Spinach, tomato, cucumber, and sliced pickled beets. Also not pictured here: I had organic spicy brown mustard to dip chicken in, was very good! I didn't use dressing for the salad, because I'm a freak and I like raw vegetables. Especially the vinegar taste from the beets gets on the other veggies anyways. 

I had another meal today in the 4 hour window, homemade keto cheddar broccoli soup. It was delicious but gave me a tummy ache because of the high fat content after fasting for so long. I did quite a lot of research on keto variation diets and intermittent fasting before beginning, but I wasn't aware that eating something fatty to break your fast can really mess up your stomach. So tomorrow, I will eat this chicken breast meal first to break fas instead. I'm all prepped now with Truvia for my black coffee, fresh lemon water, and my favorite spiced chai teas!",163za03,12,2,https://i.redd.it/7ngbqk4s9xkb1.jpg,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-28 21:51:21

Switching it up is so important!,"Remember, your body can and does adapt. Instead of being strict, I've started mixing my fasting up to better results. I've been IF on and off for several years but this is the first time I've felt things were sustainable! I'm in perimenopause and the important markers like blood pressure, better sleep and gut health and my weight started to trend steadily in the right direction only after I became more flexible to let fasting fit into my life rather than fit my life into fasting.  Doing a strict fasting schedule was leading me to not fast more than fasting because it wasn't fitting my life.

For me:

\*The only general rule is that I don't eat past 6pm most days except for socializing  
\*I reserve OMAD for days I want to go out and eat with friends and not worry about calories or eat something that I love but I need to moderate (like homemade lasagna).

\*One week a month I shift my eating cutoff from 6pm to earlier (4pm usually) but I don't maintain that longer than a week for sustainability reasons (I don't eat early in the day so cutoff too early too often means my calorie restriction is too steep for it to be sustainable).

\*I do longer fasting (36 hours usually) several times a month (2-3 but no more). Sometimes I'll do 2 in one week, sometimes I do once a week for a few weeks- whatever works for my schedule.

\*I take breaks! If I'm busy or traveling or on vacation, I also take breaks.  I generally stick to the no eating past 6pm but depending will be more flexible and aim for no eating 4 hours before bedtime when needed during a break

A healthy habit is what you do most of the time, not that you are compliant 100% of the time!  Also a healthy habit is one where you get back on track after a break. Being too strict with fasting ruined fasting for me, being more flexible and having these rules helps me maintain my progress. I'm not low carb or keto and have managed positive trends (I do avoid processed food and eat a lot of veggies)!

HELP needed! I'm going to fast 16/8 every day and doing keto + fruits menu. Is that a good idea?,"Hello friends. Let's start with some statements (before you would notice English is not my native language, so I'm sorry in advance for some strange phrases, that might occur in this post). Well, my statements, which I have grasped after 10 years of trying to lose weight and get rid of morbid obesity. 

1) I can't do classic keto forever though I can do it for long periods of time (weeks, months) but each time in the past I failed my ketosis binge eating some naughty carbs. 

2) I can't count calories, it drives me into drastic mental position and leads to being nervous and overeating before bedtime (checked 2 or 3 times).

3) I can't do 16/8 fasting without keto or LCHF, I'm a constant first day fasting rule breaker if I don't less carbs in my diet. 

4) I can't do OMAD in a long perspective, it makes me nervous. 

My situation seems so hard and I might seem to be so weak chicken (I weight about 135 kg / 297 lbs now) ... However, I'd like to give a go my own diet which is keto dishes + any fruits in an eating window + 16/8 IF. But no sugar and other carbs.

Really hungry during eating window,"I (F25) started doing IF since 8/09 and began with the 12:12 approach which wasn't hard to do. I also eat lower carb and try to avoid all processed carbs. It reduced my hunger and I felt good. Since I wasn't hungry when I woke up I could also push it to 14-17 hours and not have any discomfort. I have been cycling these different schedules, and so far have been successful. However, I noticed that even when I eat a high protein first meal with healthy fats I get very hungry about 1 hour after. I resist the feeling and try to wait 3/4 hours until the next meal, but I would really like to know why it has been happening. Before committing to IF I already cut out snacking, kept to 3  meals that were 3/4 hours apart and was eating a high protein low card diet. The main reason why I wanted to do IF is because I gained weight since last summer and lower my A1C which was at 5.1 in May. Am I doing something wrong? Is this a good or a bad sign?",163p83y,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/163p83y/really_hungry_during_eating_window/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-28 15:30:53

Good morning! First ever day of IF.,"First ever day of IF, last meal was yesterday around 4pm, it is 8:30am now. I'm about to head to the gym before work. I lead a sedentary lifestyle since I work remotely at home, and am an artist as a hobby. This morning I took ""Before"" pictures. I went to the doctor for my yearly physical a few weeks ago and was found to be around 80-100lbs overweight. I want to lose 100lbs, and be more muscular and fitter overall, and I know I can do it. I'm going to do IF, Keto, 4x/week exercise cardio + weight training, and CICO of course. I will use myfitnesspal membership to track calories and macros, this IF app to track meals, and my Fitbit to track anything else like water intake. 

Here's what I'm seeking advice for: first day back at the gym in awhile. I want to go regularly. Should I start slow? How long should I exercise for, I don't really know? When I used to be in shape and gym daily, I'd probably go anywhere from 1-2 hours, depending. Should I just hop right ino what my old routine used to be and use that as a starting point?",163kqi7,67,11,https://i.redd.it/7544l5v2hukb1.png,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-28 12:26:53

Unable to find maintenance sweet spot with IF and getting worried?,"I started IF a few months ago as it worked very well with my goals and lifestyle. I normally do OMAD - I really like having a strict schedule. I wasn't really insanely strict with it. I'd have a splash of oat milk in my coffee, maybe a teaspoon of sugar sometimes - simply because I was doing it mainly for weight loss and I didn't really get my hunger ""reactivated"" if I had some sugar in the coffee etc. 

All went well till about a month ago. I was 65 KG when I started, and I wanted to get down to 55 KG as I felt I looked best when I was at the lower end of BMI, I'm a 5'5 woman with a petite frame. My highest weight was 88KG in 2021, I lost 23 KG through generic CICO by May 2023. After OMAD, I got to 55 KG a month ago so I upped my calories to maintenance, but continued OMAD. 

I'm still tracking it well, and I've gotten even lazier with ""strictness"" - I'll have a coffee in the morning with milk and sugar, maybe a digestive biscuit or two at work - because I wasn't looking to lose any more weight, I just wanted to continue OMAD because I like and have gotten used to the schedule. 

But I'm 50 KG now! 4.5 kg lost in a month, even though I can swear I'm eating enough. I'm now considered underweight, and look it - people have been asking if I've been ill. I'm not sure what to do - for two weeks I even ate above maintenance and ate 1800 calories a day, but I've still been losing. And no, I have a sedentary job so I haven't exactly been running around with boxes in my arms, and I don't really exercise other than cycling to the shops lol. I also don't have any hormonal conditions, diabetes, or thyroid issues - I'm quite a blank slate, medically speaking.

At a loss of what to do - should I continue OMAD or stop it? I really don't want to stop doing it as it works so well with my lifestyle, and I've gotten very used to it. But I also don't want to lose any more weight, and my GP told me to stop doing IF as it was ""only for weight loss"". That didn't seem right to me, hence me asking here - please help! 

Thank you in advance!

Week 17 Accountability post: The ‚ÄúI found the reason nobody thought of that losing weight sucks‚Äù edition,"Age: 45

Sex: Male

Start date: May 1, 2023 (16 weeks)

Starting weight: 516.5

Current weight (maybe, new scale is on the way): 459.9 (-56.6 lbs)

IF plan: 18:6 during the week, 22:2 on the weekends

Exercise: No intentional exercise but I am a teacher and I‚Äôm on my feet most of the day. I also have my classroom on the 2nd floor so I‚Äôm up and down the stairs at least 4 times per day.

Diet: SAD but I‚Äôm trying to eat more veggies than I used to.

So onto the reason that losing weight sucks. I am a wet shaver. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, go check out r/wicked_edge. I use a double edged safety razor. With losing so much weight, my face geometry is seriously changing and I am constantly nicking myself when shaving. I used to nick myself maybe once a month. Now it‚Äôs at least once per shave, which I do 3 times per week. 

All that said, I‚Äôm loving the weight loss. I‚Äôve considered just growing a beard until I hit my goal weight, but it‚Äôs too hot for a beard and I love the way my shave soaps and such make me smell.

Is IF recommendable for people who recovered from EDs?,"**TW: Discussion of eating disorders!**

Hi all! I've been following discussions on this sub for a while now and have been interested in trying IF for myself, but my biggest concern is that I have recovered from a restrictive eating disorder and am not a fan of the thought of counting calories again.

As it stands, the circumstances which triggered my restrictive eating habits have changed and for two years I have been eating ""normally"" (not counting calories, mostly guiltlessly indulging in unhealthy food sometimes, trying to eat three balanced meals a day, etc..). As you can imagine, not rigorously controlling every bite I take has made me gain some weight, and I would like to shed at least five kilograms. 

(I am aware that IF is not a fad diet but a lifestyle change! I do want to keep the weight off and try to incorporate some workout into my routine too. )  


Is it possible to lose weight through IF without counting calories? Has anyone with similar circumstances had bad results with IF, or relapsed due to trying IF?

2. What are the best apps to use to help say on track that are free? 

3. What type of changes do you make to your fasting days/hours (if any) if you are new to working out? Also what are good workouts to do in the gym for quick fat loss that won‚Äôt take too much out of you while fasting? 
 
4. If you like to drink on the weekends is there a type of alcoholic drink that won‚Äôt interfere too much with the weeks fasting? 

5. When you break your fast, no matter how long it‚Äôs been, what are the best things to consume for energy and feeling satisfied?

Intermittent Fasting Almost equals skipping breakfast??,"When I was a kid I was taught to never skip breakfast. Especially if you are trying to lose weight. Your body interprets that as starving so it tries to hold on to the fat. So for the first roughly 50 years of my life I always tried to eat three square meals at least. Preferably, I would sort of graze from when I got up until a few hours before bed. That was both healthy and the way to lose fat. At least that's what I read in a lot of books. Don't skip breakfast! Don't starve yourself!

However, I just realized today that for the first time in my life I am consistently losing weight. I expect the scale to consistently go down and it does. And I'm mostly doing it by only eating between roughly 10-11 AM and 6-7 PM. Given how early I often get up and how active I am during it, I am effectively skipping breakfast.

Can anyone help me reconcile this?

Results are finally showing from this summer! ( 220lb to 199lb in 45 days),"SW: 220lb
CW: 200lb
GW: 175lb


In Photo 1 I was 220lbs tired of looking overweight and always feeling bloated, heavy and constipated. I gave intermittent fasting a try after a lot of research online and on youtube and it seemed to be the only way to lose weight without having to go through crash dieting and overburdening and stressing myself. 

I started with 16 hours and then moved onto 18 hour fasting by the end of the first week. Managing to lose around 5 pounds of water weight in the first week. I was instantly surprised by the results since i was already feeling more fresh and active throughout my day while fasting. 

After 45 days of intermittent fasting, ( mainly consisting of 18 hour fasting 4 days a week and 3 days of OMAD 20-22 hour fasts) I started noticing massive difference in terms of my clothing sizes and body weight. Turns out, i now weigh just under 200 pounds which is pretty crazy to me. My clothes that would previously not fit me are now lose! My waist went from 38 inches to under 36 inches now and im feeling great!

I could not tell the difference until i took the second picture yesterday morning in the mirror. Most of my inflated belly is now gone and I am surprised by how all of this was possible in such a short amount of time. 

My GW is 175lbs and i would be starting the gym this month to make sure i build some muscle alongside losing all this fat.

Would love advice,"So my doc has me doing an 8-hour eating window (insulin resistance). It‚Äôs pretty easy unless I play Pickleball in the evenings. Normally I‚Äôll do a 12-8. But if I play Pickleball, it goes 5:30-9:00. I def can‚Äôt eat before playing because I‚Äôll puke lol

Which approach do you think would be better on the days that I play pickleball?

Eat a big ass lunch and fuel up and only eat between 12-3. 
(I could def do this one if I ate enough. Just not sure if it‚Äôs healthy for my body to not get any nutrition after so much exercise.)

Or 
Move my eating window to 1:30-9:30. The downside here is that I would basically eat and go straight to bed which I also know isn‚Äôt good either.

However, these past 10 days I haven't lost a single kg and in fact I even gained almost 1.5kg (I don't feel the courage to check my measurements so I'll do that maybe after 2 weeks) I hold myself responsible for the fact that I wasn't doing IF properly these days and on the days I did, I wasn't staying in a calorie deficit. I also don't blame myself in anyway for any of these because I know that my mental health wasn't the best these past few days and it's also important to be kind towards myself.

‚Ä¢ Eating something ""unhealthy"" at least once a day. It can be just a piece of bread with Nutella, a handful of potato chips, a few biscuits, a piece of dark chocolate or maybe even coffee with milk and sugar... I just can't help having something I really crave and I really need to work on it.

Thoughts on the Zig-Zag Caloric Intake method?,So I (20F/5‚Äô9/178.4 lbs) had made a post a while back when I was 184 lbs about my weight not going down fast enough and got a lot of advice on it. Anyways the commenters on that post gave me great feedback and my weight has been steadily decreasing since but I‚Äôm trying to avoid another plateau like the one I had at 184 lbs. The zig-zag caloric method takes a persons total weekly caloric intake and then breaks it up unevenly throughout the week so that you eat different amounts of calories daily but the same amount weekly so that your body does not grow accustomed to eating a fixed amount of calories daily thus creating the plateau. Have you guys tried this method or heard of it? What are your thoughts on it? Would it be a good method to incorporate with intermittent fasting?,16298wf,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16298wf/thoughts_on_the_zigzag_caloric_intake_method/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-26 22:47:56

Right now I am trying to adjust to 16:8. I am still struggling to do 16:8 manly due to time constraints for my meal. I want to do strict 16:8 and then try to move towards 20:4 and eventually OMAD.

However, if I am already in deficit is it necessary for me to try do 20:4. Is there any significant advantages of having a smaller earing window? 

Any advice would he highly appreciated.",161mua2,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/161mua2/cico_or_if/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-26 06:03:00

Insulin Resistance / Folks Tracking Glucose,"I just bought a glucose and ketone blood monitor, and it‚Äôs making me question things. I‚Äôm doing 17:7 ish for about a month.  I have PCOS which makes me naturally insulin resistant and have about 40-50 pounds I need to lose. 

Last night, about 3.5 hours into my fast and about an hour before bed, my glucose was 102.   I woke up 13.5 hours into my fast this morning and the glucose was up to 108 without having eaten anything since last reading.  Odd, but I read online about the Dawn phenomenon and how hormones in the morning can spike glucose right before you wake up.  So that probably explains it.  No biggie.  

But then I fasted 17 hours total and glucose right before lunch dipped to 87.  Which is great and what I wanted.    An hour and a half after lunch it 89.  Great!  Stable glucose. No crazy spikes.  causing 

But then, I took it again 4 hours after lunch (about 3.5 hours fasted, no snacks or food since last reading), and it jumped to 111.   

So‚Ä¶. My question is‚Ä¶.is anyone else seeing ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù glucose spikes?   Especially those with diabetes, prediabetes or insulin resistance?   

All the standard tests and recommendations say check your blood sugar 1-2 hours after meals.  So, if mine is stable then but doesn‚Äôt really jump until 4-5 hours after I eat, I find that odd.  

Is anyone else having this phenomenon in their blood glucose readings and if so ‚Äî- any idea why this is happening?

Thanks in advance.  I‚Äôm gonna keep testing and experimenting, but I‚Äôm just perplexed why physicians are saying to check only 1-2 hours after eating if that‚Äôs not when my body is actually spiking.",161hvoc,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/161hvoc/insulin_resistance_folks_tracking_glucose/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-26 01:46:28

Just discouraged and need to vent,"I've been doing IF for over 5 years, I dropped weight pretty quick along with staying active and it's helped a lot with stomach and digestive issues. Lately I've been eating a lot more, even with upping my workouts (one hour every day, from 30 minutes 4 days a week) and I've been trying really hard to transition from 16:8 to 18:6 with one day of OMAD. I know part of it is just water weight from a big, salty meal last night, but I've gained 8lbs in the last month. I'm assuming the next day or two I'll drop a pound or two from water weight, but it's still discouraging. I'm thinking about going back to 16:8 with one day of OMAD and seeing if that helps. I feel like I was a lot less hungry when I did an 8 hour eating window. My biggest issue is I start work around 4am and right now I don't eat until 11 or 12, and then I stop eating by 5 or 6.

Restarting the grind!,"I just returned to college about a week ago and my last logged weight was 148.4 lbs which meant I was 10 lbs down. The week before I returned my dad kept getting me my favorite treats and this past week I only fasted 2-3 times.

I was only doing cardio in the summer but I began resistance training today. I did a 25 minute workout for core and arms and feel great and motivated. 

My plan from here on out is 20:4 five days a week, with weekends off while I‚Äôm socializing, although I will keep track of roughly how many calories I eat and try to stay below 1750 (around my TDEE on sedentary) and on days I fast I will eat around 1400-1500 calories. The deficit on its own should bring me down half a lb a week, although perhaps more depending how consistently I exercise. Plan is to do 2x a week resistance trainings and 2x a week cardio (45 mins on gym bike or 20 mins on stairmaster for now)

Lack of support bumming me out.,"I (51F, 5‚Äô5‚Äù, SW218, CW158, GW145) have been IF pretty strictly since February, and I‚Äôm currently down 60lbs. Unlike a lot of people, what works best for me is eating in the morning and fasting for the rest of the day so I go to bed with an empty stomach. It works for me, and even better, it‚Äôs been EASY for me to do. For the first time, I feel like I‚Äôm losing weight successfully without having to white-knuckle it through every day with a combo of willpower and strict calorie counting. 

The problem is that almost every social event I participate in involves eating in the evening. Family gatherings, birthdays, meeting friends at a restaurant for dinner, open air concerts with food trucks. The problem is not with me resisting the food, the problem is with everyone around me getting mad that I‚Äôm not eating. My sister is probably the worst of the bunch. 

We live very enmeshed lives. We live on the same block, raised our kids together, pretty much do everything together, along with my husband. We joke that she‚Äôs his ‚Äúsister wife‚Äù because they sometimes do more things together than he and I do (my job often involves working in the evenings, theirs do not, so if I can‚Äôt join them at a social event or bike ride with the kids, the two of them just go together and I have zero issue with that)

My sister is divorced and while a little overweight, she is very healthy, active, and quite comfortable in her skin. She thinks diets are crap and we should all just do intuitive eating, eat healthy foods, and accept our bodies as they are.

That‚Äôs fine, but *I* was desperately unhappy being obese. I‚Äôm an athlete in my heart, and when I was 220lbs, I just felt like I was wearing a fat suit. I couldn‚Äôt do the things I wanted to do, and the person in the mirror didn‚Äôt seem like me. 

I told my family when I started IF that I was going to be VERY strict about it until I reached my goal weight/range (140-150). Then I would relax the rules a bit and keep IF on regular days, but eat in the evenings during social situations. 

The problem is that my sister is constantly making passive aggressive and sometimes downright mean comments any time we‚Äôre together and I don‚Äôt eat. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve declined a serving of something by saying, ‚ÄúNo thanks, I can‚Äôt eat in the evening‚Äù just to have her declare, ‚ÄúYes, you CAN eat in the evenings, you‚Äôre just CHOOSING not to!‚Äù

True, but she knows why, she knows how much happier I am since I‚Äôve been losing weight, but every time I‚Äôm with her during evening meals (which is probably 50% of all evenings), she has to make a comment about how stupid it is to not eat. Keep in mind, she had done IF before herself, but she fasted in the morning. Apparently that‚Äôs not a problem for her, but me fasting in the evening is.

Last night I felt so defeated. She made dinner at her house (across the street from mine). She let us all know food was ready, and two of my kids went over to eat. My 15-yr-old son texted me soon after and asked if I was coming to hang out, and that he thought my sister wanted me to. I hadn‚Äôt gone over because sometimes if I‚Äôm particularly hungry, hanging out around the smells of a delicious meal while everyone else eats is just kind of hard. This wasn‚Äôt a special meal, just a regular weeknight. However, I went over to visit, didn‚Äôt say anything about eating/not eating, take one portion to save for my meal the next morning, and thought that was it. Later, my son mentioned to me in passing, ‚Äú(sis‚Äôs name) thinks you care more about losing weight that you care about your family.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not going to blow up my relationship with my sister over this, but it just makes me sad that the person I‚Äôm probably closest to in the world (yes, I‚Äôm definitely closer to her than my husband, but that‚Äôs a post for an entirely different sub!) seems to be trying to sabotage me, or at the very least make me feel bad/wrong about fasting.

"Losing Weight, Gaining Self Control","I (30f) have been researching fasting on and off for years, working up to some 72 hour fasts and skipping breakfast here and there but nothing consistent enough to monitor results.

I have been between the same 15-20 pounds for the past EIGHT years. And that is just what I can track with my apple weight app. I haven‚Äôt been under 200 pounds for as long as I can remember. 

I started doing Twomad and OMAD and 20:4 and I think I‚Äôve finally found my sweet spot. The best part is that it feels natural for me. Drinking water, unsweetened tea, and focusing on how to get the most protein into my only meal for the day is something I can see myself doing for the rest of my weight loss journey and even into maintaining my weight once I reach it. At 225 and 5‚Äô8, I only want to lose about 45 pounds total.

The reason I‚Äôve never been able to see results in those 8 years is because I didn‚Äôt understand CICO, didn‚Äôt care for meal timings, emotionally ate, and wasn‚Äôt consistent with ANYTHING. Also, homeostasis lol. I‚Äôve been consistent for the past week eating this way and I‚Äôm so excited.

I just wanted to share how excited I was about feeling this is going to work this time around. I want to be able to look back at this post and see that consistency was the missing puzzle piece all along, and it‚Äôs all smooth sailing from here on out. The self control I feel from deciding to eat once a day and not fall into temptation (even when I‚Äôm preparing food for others!) is an amazing feeling.

Time restricted eating vs caloric deficit?,"Just listened to a Peter Attia podcast with Sam Harris, and they discus eating in broad lines. He claims that actually, almost all benefits and weight loss, or most, comes from caloric deficit.
IF is an intermediary, ""just"" helping people to maintain caloric deficit by making them more aware of what they are eating, more protein and fats, which makes people more satiated and kess likely to eat carbs in the firm of junk.

So, is that actually how this works?
Lots of people here write as if the fasting itself is the big benefit, which is in contrast to what he says.",1610xhj,18,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1610xhj/time_restricted_eating_vs_caloric_deficit/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-25 14:31:45
"Doing 2 meals a day instead of 4, volume of food is lower as well. Is oil, salt, or something else the culprit here?","I regularly intermittent fast 14-16 hours a day and eat 4 meals a day, 1 small one pre workout and 3 post workout. I regular track calories and have a pretty good estimate of calories just by looking at the food I'm eating.

I'm now on vacation. I'm working out less and using this as an opportunity to take a 2 week active recovery period. So I'm still lifting, but less weight, and still doing the same cardio (30 minutes of walking a day). There is no way for me to track my food since I'm visiting my extended family and they are cooking so instead I eat lunch and dinner with my family and nothing else. This gives me an eating window of about 5-6 hours and the rest of the day is fasting.

I've noticed that during this trip, I am getting more flabby and appear to be gaining body fat. However, by just observing what I'm eating, I am not sure how. I have one small bowl of rice with lunch and dinner (bowl a small one that my fist can barely fit into and I fill about half of it with rice). I typically meal prep rice on my normal diet and the rice I've been eating is about 1/3 in visual volume compared to what I normally eat. Besides that, I've just been eating whatever vegetables (usually brocolli) and meat are provided on the table, usually chicken or beef, but occasionally seafood like shrimp or similar that I don't know the name of. In terms of meat, I do my best to eat around 8oz of meat with each meal, purely visualizing. Besides these two meals, I did bring protein powder with me and have one scoop before each meal which roughly brings my total protein intake to high enough to just maintain.

The only thing I cannot account for is I can tell everything is way more seasoned than what I normally eat and is also cooked in a decent amount of oil. But I can't imagine oil to add that many more calories. I also thought it could be the sodium, since my typical diet doesn't have too much sodium and I'm actually sweating way more during my light workouts here vs my higher intensity ones back home. Finally, I can honestly say I haven't been hungry this entire trip. I'm eating just to spend time with my family, but I could probably skip lunch too (already skip breakfast). It's odd because back home, I'm literally ravenous after each meal regardless of how much I eat, and visually it looks like I'm eating less here than at home. How is it possible I'm slowly gaining body fat?",16108u8,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16108u8/doing_2_meals_a_day_instead_of_4_volume_of_food/,intermittentfasting,new,2023-08-25 14:05:07

F*ck it works!,"I'm 39M 168H.  SW: 99 (218 lbs), CW: 88 (194 lbs), GW:65 (143 lbs)

I started my journey in May. Since then, I have lost 11 kg and still have 23 kg to go. My adaptation period to the new lifestyle was around 1 month.

I have been doing IF 16:8 for almost 100 days without a break. Starting in July, I joined a gym and go 3 times per week. I do my workouts in the morning right before my first meal. In general, I eat 2 times per day: breakfast and an early dinner (around 4-5 pm). I also take a mineral complex, which helps a lot to reduce lightheadedness and disorientation.

The way I live right now has brought my relationship with food back to normal. I feel physically and mentally more energised. Even my body strength has improved a lot.

I love this community. You gave me hope that I could solve this on my own. You showed me that anything is possible, no matter your age, gender, or occupation. Only willpower and discipline matter.

PSA: The Sub is Intermittentfasting not judge people who have not lost 100lbs,"I have been noticing a trend here that really frustrating. The sub is called Intermittent Fasting,, To often we see people who post flat stomachs and their after picture is abs. That's amazing that they have transformed themselves and become comfortable in their skin., but when you look at the comment section there is always people calling them out for being skinny before. This sub is about Intermittent Fasting. Anyone can fast intermittently, This is not just a Weight loss Sub. Sure, Weight loss is a great side effect of Intermittent Fasting. The weight loss aspect of the sub is a huge reason why i am here as I am currently about 40lbs down out of a total of 80-100 that i want to lose.

If Terry Crews or Rich Fronning were to post on here about his IF would we just say you cant post here because you are already fit. No we could use them as examples on how to be successful. Many people on here just use IF as a way to control their intake. In all honesty thats why i started. It gave me an outlet to not mindlessly eat because i could only eat during my window. This stopped the late night snacking for me and caused me to immediately start to see results. Can we just start being happy for everyone and not just the people that lost significant weight. IF is about so much more then weightloss, the health benefits alone and just gaining the mental strength to break bad habits are what we are all here for. The weight is just a side effect of the process.",cmfftt,5901,193,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/cmfftt/psa_the_sub_is_intermittentfasting_not_judge/,intermittentfasting,top,2019-08-05 19:13:47

***This group took me over the finish line. I am so GRATEFUL for all your knowledge and helpfulness. Especially when learning about BMR and TDEE. Sorry this post is long- tried to answer potential questions up front. 

Reason for weight loss: cholesterol, arthritis, feel/look/ better. 

I used MyFitnessPal, logged food and charted weight every day. 

pics are during entire weight loss time period. Started in Oct 2020 at 200 lbs (lower right). Lost 15.2 lbs via CICO to get to 184.8 (polka dot dress) and stopped. In June 2022, started again, adding in IF and walking. Goal weight reached yesterday (119.4)! (Pink gingham shirt and bathing suit).
Total of 80.6 lbs down over 3 years. 

If you like numbers: 

Cholesterol down 60 pts
Triglycerides down 144 pts

Following changes are from 200 lb start to 119.4 lb finish:
Shirt size: 1x/xxl to small
Pant size: 18w to 6p
Shoe size: 6.5 to 6
Ring size: 7 to 5.25

Body sizes are from Oct 2022 (158.9 lbs to now), because I did not start measuring until then:
6.5‚Äù off bust
9.5‚Äù off waist
7.5‚Äù off hips
Waist to hip ratio: .9 to .83

Walking: started at 10 mins a day because I felt like CRAP. Worked up to jog/walk 30 mins a day. Past two weeks have added in 3lb weights to each hand. 

Food: berries, dark leafy greens, chickpeas, walnuts, protein shake for midday meal, Dinner was Lean Cuisines because I wanted calories already figured out. Allowed some salty/crunchy snacks.

I learned: I needed to HYDRATE. Blood pressure went too low at one point. Had to up the water and salt. 
Doctor is thrilled with progress! 
I no longer get the shakes if I don‚Äôt eat every 3 to 4 hours.
Acid reflux gone.
I don‚Äôt notice my joints as much.

Future plans: keep walking. Keep weight between 120-125. Add in calories slowly to find the maintenance spot.",14dnttn,5551,258,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14dnttn,intermittentfasting,top,2023-06-19 19:17:57

Triggered by medical weight loss,"I recently lost 70 lbs in 3 months because my stomach stopped working and now I'm starting to get triggered by my weight loss and body. I have a feeding tube which means I could throw easily get away with not eating enough because I'd know exactly how much I've got a day and I'm just scared because I'm already malnourished from 3 months of complete starvation and being in the hospital. I lost my period and some of my hair but my old eating disorder is starting to eat at me. The horrible thing is I didn't even want to lose that weight to begin with I was comfortable with myself and food for the first time and had put on so much muscle weight lifting and eating well and now it's all gone. Now I want to lose another 40 lbs and idk if my body would survive that this year.

Haunted,"I had anorexia when I was 15 years old and restricted. I recovered several years ago but my brain stayed in a state of wanting to be always thinner although I didn't restrict. I somehow learned how to love food again but the guilt after I finished my meals never went away.

Lately I developed several food allergies, inexplicably. Suddenly I can't eat bread, wine, sugar, candy, pastries, milk or pasta. These foods cause me pain and gastric issues, and as a consequence now I am afraid of eating once again. This time because I'm afraid of the pain that it causes me.

So now I'm restricting again. And I feel in the danger zone because I may be slipping again into my ED.

I feel this disease is being haunting me thorough my life and now that I developed food allergies it's found the perfect entryway. I find myself bodychecking again, I enjoy when my weight goes down and I feel good because I have no gastric pains and the weight loss feels like a win.

It's like this constant itch to always be thinner even when I was recovered got empowered by itself and now it has found a new best friend (my food allergies) to kill my love for food and creep into my life stronger than ever.

I don't know why I'm sharing this. I'm not upset or worried. I feel actually happy. As if I'm getting things my way and the pain of not being thin enough will disappear once and for all this time once I reach my goal.",16s24rd,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16s24rd/haunted/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-25 19:57:06

Is there any way I can help this woman who I fear may die soon?,"First things first I know very little about this subject so please forgive any ignorance on this topic. 

There is a woman who's started going to my gym who looks extremely close to death because of the level of malnourishment, but I don't know if it's due to any particular disease  or anorexia. 

The first time I saw her my whole body instantly went cold, this extremely frail woman who is so thin she can barely walk hobbled into the gym looking like she was very very close to death. To explain just how frail she is - she looks skinnier than the famous Eugene Cooney girl I've seen on YouTube, and much less mobile too with a more gaunt face.

My wife was in the gym changing rooms when the woman finished working out (it's not really working out  much as she can barely move) and my wife said the first thing the lady did on entering the changing rooms was step on the scales, which makes me thing it might be anorexia or an eating disorder. 

Can I help or reach out in any way? I worry she may be all alone and have no one to talk to, but don't know what to say.

Im a Caucasian living in Taiwan, and this woman is one of the few other caucasians here, so I worry she may not have a support group, as not many people speak good English here, and the society is very insular and doesn't reach out to strangers. I asked the staff at the gym if anyone has talked to her, they say they've seen her in there a few times but no one has said anything.

I'd like to offer help if I can in any way because I honestly think she looks like she could die any day in her condition, but don't know what to say or how to do it. That's why I'm here seeking out if anyone has ideas on anything I could do.",16rvyjp,14,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16rvyjp/is_there_any_way_i_can_help_this_woman_who_i_fear/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-25 15:58:16
Pregnant and i find it so triggering,"Please help. I am 31 and pregnant with my second child. I have an eating disorder that was left untreated and undiagnosed, because where I lived anorexia wasn‚Äôt taken seriously. I‚Äôve managed it myself and wasn‚Äôt ever hospitalized, but I guess everyone knew because how low my body weight was. The lowest point, I know I cant post numbers, was right after I gave birth. I have a naturally slim body type so it didn‚Äôt take long before I actually looked like the horror pictures from the internet. Whenever I would go through a tough time, like after divorce, my eating disorder got quite bad. Anywas, in the past year or so I managed it pretty well and started looking what others would deem normal. I got pregnant and I‚Äôm gaining weight pretty fast at only 11 weeks I cant zip any of my pants. The reason I find this so scary is because from the ages of anorexia onset at 12 or 13, i was totally fine at 18, unbothered by food obsession. Then my dad died, it got a little bad, but not scary - but gaining weight in my high risk pregnancy drove me the edge at postpartum, it was so bad I lost hair, had so many other health issues‚Ä¶ what I am asking is how to balance this act. I am ok now, yes, so scared of my body, but I am eating a more than decent amount of food, but I worry that as soon as I have the baby, I will starve myself all over again if I gain the same weight I did with my first one. I am staying active, I asked my OBGYN but they‚Äôre advice was to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù. Does anyone have experience here? How to gain a normal amount of weight, not too much, like 15 kilos tops?

Last week my friend and one of my teachers told me to book an appointment with my school counselor. So I did and I told him I was struggling.

He asked me what was up and I told him about how I‚Äôve been skipping meals and restricting heavily. I struggled in the past with this but it had gotten better. I didn‚Äôt tell him about the Sh because I knew he would call my mom. We had talked about some other stuff that had been going on. Eventually near the end he started to ask more questions about my eating such as do you purge, I said no. ( I‚Äôve tried on multiple occasions but was never successful.) Then he told me that he has to call my mom now. So he is calling her tomorrow. I‚Äôm sure she won‚Äôt react badly but I‚Äôm scared of her knowing. I feel that once she knows about it then I‚Äôm going to lose that sense of control again. And I am terrified to lose that. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Major relapse two yrs into recovery,"Help!! So I'm a senior at uni and I'm working on not just my thesis but postgrad PhD applications, plus I have a full semester course load, a fantastic job in my field and an internship which is amazing for said postgrad applications. Somehow though I'm sinking further into ed behaviors and thought patterns, returning to restriction, etc, after being displeased with my weight and appearance for months (understatement of the year, I've been miserable. I used to rlly love fashion and makeup, and I can't even look at myself in the mirror long enough to put together an outfit or look). 

I'm rlly worried, as I need to keep my brain operating at 100% capacity to carry me through the next two semesters and into postgrad. I'm two years into recovery (weight restoration, no calorie counting, etc) but with just a month into what I thought was a minor relapse I'm fully back to counting, obsessive exercise, body checking, the works. I'm rlly scared, as I started working on my thesis this week and I can already tell I'm I'm tired and losing focus easily. The words aren't coming like they used to, and my work isn't as good as it was.

I'm worried I'm ruining my chances at a future that I've worked so hard for with this relapse... but I've been so miserable w my body that I don't know which is better. I can't bear the body I have in recovery, but I need to be recovered to finish my thesis, grad apps... any advice?

I can't change my body despite hating it,"I'm embarrassed I'm even posting this.

I hate my body with a passion. I never want to be *severely* underweight again where I looked like a walking corpse, but I still want to be thin like a model.

 I want to be a certain weight that is lower than where I'm at, but I can't. My parents. They are trying to protect me but it feels like they're killing me. I'm 19 and can't move out at this current time because inflation is through the roof. I'm also a full-time student. 

I just have to wait until fall 2024 before I can be free and off to college. I love my parents but hate that they're doing this to me.

Mom just found out and I'm terrified,"General TW, no numbers but ED symptoms, general concern by family, etc 

I woke up and had breakfast at the table while she was doing homework, and then she suddenly told me I looked sick like I had red eyes and asked me if was ok and said if I had any problems I could tell her. So i said I felt ok but woke up with a sore throat and she kinda forgot about it. 

I complained about a stupid assignment my English teacher sent me and how I felt like it trivialized depression. Dumb move on my part I know. She started talking about mental health and all. Then she started talking about how her sister was anorexic and REALLY talking about anorexia and health problems etc and commenting about how I wasnt eating that much, and I was really annoyed.

Then I told her that she was never this concerned when I was bulimic and started crying and saying she had never cared about my bulimia at all, which was a real actual issue, and now she's more worried about this, which is something she's making up in her head (I don't know if I really believe this or if it was just something I said to get her to stop). She said that it wasn't true and that she really cared when I was bulimic and hugged me, and I thought the conversation was over and I'd won, but then she asked me ""how can I help you with this"" and I was like ""lol im not bulimic anymore remember"" and she said ""no with anorexia"" and I told her that was stupid and that I ate more than the average anorexic and than my average classmate and then she kinda shut up, like she still kept claiming I had an ED, but she shut up.

She said I looked tired yesterday, which I denied because I didn't actually feel tired tbh, and then about how she had never seen any blood in the bathroom trashcan in the past few months (ofc since I've been missing my period). Except for a used tampon which by her standards had little blood (it wasn't mine but explaining how I got it would count as pro so I'm keeping my mouth shut), so thanks to it all ended in ""maybe it's a side effect from your past bulimia (I told her I had lost my period in March while bulimic), let's wait until the next month and if you don't bleed normally we will see a gynecologist"" (idk how im going to survive this one). At least my last labs were fine even though she says she doesn't know how.

When I went to put my empty plate away to the kitchen and came back, she grabbed my hand and said it was cold and that she often sees me with a blanket on even if it's hot, to which I replied that I eat a lot of cold food.

Lately, like since the past month, she's also been commenting a lot on my weight loss and ""how thin I am""

I think she also suspects I'm not eating my school lunch and she's right because I am not and I'm very scared 

Also some days ago she was watching an AN documentary

I'm scared that if I lose any more weight she will just think she is right and I will be forced to stop because I don't want to. I know I shouldn't but I really hate her rn because she's always trying to get me to eat junk and food I can't eat. One time she asked me why was I so afraid of food and that's not true and I felt really angry and offended and thought a lot of mean things towards her. I'm getting angry now just by remembering it

This will also seem dumb but I don't actually feel like I'm really anorexic tbh. Like I'm on this sub because it's the only place i can really post about these things but I feel like it's more of a diet because I actually eat a lot. I know this seems like a troll post but I'm so scared because in a month if I don't manage to have a normal period (or make it seem like I have one) I will be taken to the gynecologist and maybe all of this will be over and they'll try to fatten me up and she will just get what she wants which is a fatass daughter (idk why) and I want to cry",16quxb0,29,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16quxb0/mom_just_found_out_and_im_terrified/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-24 11:01:18

Unwilling to recover right now but desperate for therapy," I (23F) have been undiagnosed with anorexia nervosa for about 3 years now. I've also been dealing with depression right along with it for the 3 years, plus unbearable social anxiety for like 10 years. 

 I wanna go to therapy to address my problems so that I can hopefully get medicated for my anxieties and find a solution for my depression because I want to live a better and happier life for my boyfriend, my cats, and my dogs.

 I'm nervous to go to therapy though because if I heal my anxieties and my depression, will I really feel the desire to starve myself? I haven't been to my goal weight and I'm so worried I'm losing time to do it. I've never been hospitalized or so much had recognition of my ED aside of my boyfriend, and now my mom getting a little suspicious of my eating.

 I'm so on the fence about deciding whether I should go to therapy, I just don't wanna lose control and get recovered when I feel like I'm still barely getting started.",16ql74n,10,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16ql74n/unwilling_to_recover_right_now_but_desperate_for/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-24 01:39:02

Rib Sprain / Fracture - Take Care of Your Bodies,"Hi,

Just want to tell you all to be careful out there. Had severe rib pain on right side due to purging food and overexercise of an oblique machine. Bones are already weak and have to be super careful. Pain was about a 9/10 and had to take ibuprofen. Side effects included facial bloating and severe edema. 

Take care of your bodies. Take a break sometimes. Relax.

What feels like success,"So I've been afraid of writing this because I so don't want to get banned but it's part of my recovery.
I'm starting to have 3 meals again not perfectly but close. I still have the same meals and foods that I prefer 
Anyway, lately, my shirt, jeans, and ring size have gone up in size. So I assume I was gaining again because I relapsed in July.
So after a month of not checking my weight, I got on the scale ready to be depressed for the rest of the day. I got one there and it read more than once that I'm less than I was a month ago.
Hear me out, last year I was the smallest I've been in my life, the I refer without knowing about overshooting which happened while in treatment that they didn't tell me about. Long story short, this past summer has been thee biggest I've been in my life, we're talking over twice as much as I weighed last year. It's messed with my head but the numbers coming down and not being what I assumed it was good to see. I tried to look up what this could be. I've gotten alot of the same tak out. So I'm assuming sodium maybe I dk. Either way, I'm eating more so called normally. No diets. No excerizing, im literally been recovering from a leg/hip injury.
Just anything, as I was taught all food is good especially while recovering.
I have heard that in recovering the weight can go very height before it starts getting to the set point. 
Again I'm just sharing this because of the excitement I feel about my recovery. I'm in no way trying to enable any Ed behaviors.",16qifqt,7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16qifqt/what_feels_like_success/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-23 23:24:28

Feel like failing at trying to stop engaging in behaviors,"Yesterday I went out with friends and ‚Äúover ate‚Äù and purged it. Today I haven‚Äôt eaten and I know I‚Äôm going to be fasting for a while.

I used to fast for days at a time even when severely underweight. I also used to purge a lot. None of this was because of binging, sometimes it‚Äôd be for like an extra few cals or even if I just ‚Äúfelt like it‚Äù. Even when I didn‚Äôt fast my usual eating schedule was just an omad.

Recently I‚Äôve been doing better. I‚Äôve been eating 3 meals a day! This is a big improvement for me even if it‚Äôs still just at or a little under maintenance. I‚Äôve been feeling better and having some amount of energy. I don‚Äôt want to give it up, but the urges to fast are unavoidable right now. I guess what I‚Äôm asking is how do I not beat myself up for not being perfect all the time? I know what I‚Äôm doing isn‚Äôt considered recovery but I‚Äôve had anorexia for years so this time I‚Äôm taking it slow and the 3 meals has been a really good step and has been working for me. But in other words lke how do I not beat myself up for ‚Äúfailing at recovery‚Äù or just like engaging in behaviors I haven‚Äôt done in a while? Being so hard on myself is somehow triggering me to fast more. I want to be able to accept it and move on and continue on my path to recovery tomorrow 

Alsoo please please don‚Äôt come after me telling me this isn‚Äôt recovery. I am aware.

Story: The cycle of suffering as a family member,"*This is a short story that reflects my inner struggles of being a family member of someone with Anorexia and caring for her. I deeply respect people with this illness and I try to be as sensible as I can. If something I said is accidentally inconsiderate or even offending, please let me know - I am eager to learn and will act accordingly.* ***That being said, the struggles as a supporting person are very intense and can lead to very dark places including topics regarding death. It can get very depressing at times, and if you are not comfortable with these topics, it is perfectly okay and even advised to not continue reading.*** *I wanted to portray an honest and accurate picture of my emotions and thought patterns to give others insight into the areas of the mind people in supporting positions don't usually talk about openly. I often found solace in stories like these, because they have the potential to validate one's emotions, so now its my turn. I hope I can provide some value to you with my work!*

\---

It's been five years since they started showing symptoms. ""Can you help me with this?"", she said. ""Sure!"", I proclaimed, not knowing what I was signing up for. I think nobody can ever fathom the dimensions of life drain this illness holds. I do not have Anorexia, but I have other types of addiction - I understand on some level, but there's this uniqueness of Ana that gives it a special place in hell for everybody.

Days went by, months and eventually years. Years full of tears, holding her in my arms while she's fearfully shaking after seeing her legs in the reflection of a store window and of course the ever growing shadow of hopelessness. ""This is killing me."" ""I know."" A sentence that came from us both, trying to drift along in the tides of uncertainty. A land where suddenly the most harmless of things can pose a threat to our well being, our sanity and eventually our very sense of self. There is no I in this anymore. We're in this together. Or to rephrase it: The path that leads me out of this is long overgrown. Too many lies were told. Too many times the bond of trust was broken and repaired. Too much of my life was sacrificed so I could hold her hand in an existence that is dancing towards the inevitable demise. Until this day, I do not fully understand what it is that fuels her need to compete. How the root of deep self loathing leads to a restriction of the very thing that gives us life. Maybe her choice is, in fact, death.

Last night she came to me, casually conversing about things that happen in life. I feel, that despite this all encompassing entity of darkness, it is important to remind people with ED's that they are human, loved and deserve an ordinary life with ordinary problems and joys - if they want that of course!

In a split second she switched the topic to the question: ""Is it problematic if my heart rate was only \[censored\] bpm over the day?"" ""Yes"", I calmly answered, while repressing any fearful emotion that's arising within me. Hearing things like these are of course shocking, but they occured so frequently that I know from experience that nothing I could have said would have gotten her to change her actions. This is no emergency anymore, this is routine. Deep despair makes people cling to the only thing that they can control, even if it means taking their life.

A split second later, the conversation was continued. It was probably about someone who did something and as a result something happened. I frankly don't know. After she posed the heart related question, my mind went blank. I felt like in a glass tunnel, surrounded by roaring thunder, seeing the blinding brightness of lightnings that my synapses fired - all from a distance that made me feel protected.

The conversation was finished and we moved our seperate ways to go to bed. I could sense, that the answer I gave her, pushed her mountain of uncertainty to the side just right in order to get a fairly good night's sleep. The next morning she woke up before me, and as I dragged myself out of bed in the afternoon, she was already gone spending time with her friends.  I'm happy for her, that she finally has friends who accept her, at least the side of her that she can comfortably show to people.

During the time she spent in the land of dreams, my eyes felt forced to stay open, just like as in old cartoons where they put toothpicks between their eyelids. Even if I wanted to, I could not sleep, yet  nonetheless felt like I'm in a dream. Memories of failed attempts to support her crept up on me, the emotions of long gone, seemingly small events knocked on the door of my conciousness, almost tranquil, but with a never ending sense of threat. It was almost a very meditative state, but fear managed to take overhand. I believe there is only a finite amout of heavy load a human can carry for others before they collapse. The fear had finally gotten the rest of me, I burned out. Literally. I could feel my nerves firing above their threshold of safety, reaching their upper limit of exitatory potential and then dying out quietly. The pain of having to care about a deeply suffering person is severely diminished, but so is everything else. I feel like this fear burnt out the life energy in myself. I am deeply thankful for the human mind to be able to protect me like this, but every time I experience these states I feel like I lost a part of my soul that I can never get back.

""I think I'm done now. Nothing in the situation has changed at all, but I feel this very serene sense of freedom. I've seen being supportive as my duty, but right now I'm trying to fight God. In the beginning I strived for peace and happiness and look what I've now become. A casualty, a firefighter who surrendered to the flames inside of a burning house. I might have done more harm than good. I might have unknowingly saved her life a dozen times. I'll never know. Either way, I deserve rest. Deep rest.  I've realized that at the bottom of the rabbit hole, behind all the small habits, annoyances, hopes and dreams, victories and faliures, love and isolation lies only one question: Do you choose life or death?

Ultimately, the choice is hers. No human can ever fully comprehend the complex existential malady of a mind that is opting for death. A bunch of zeroes and ones crossing inside their subconscious mind, evaluating every single part of one's existence in a profound depth that not even the person itself can fathom. To think that humans are powerful enough to harshly intervene in such a horrific, yet morbidly beautiful natural phenomenon from the outside is not only heavily megalomanic, but results in soul shattering agony as their attempt of treatment is effectively just a way to steal the last particle of agency in a suffering person's life. I will always remind her of the beautiful side of life, the simple joy of being and the unifying love she is worthy to give and recieve. If her choice is death, then so be it.

I just know that while fighting for her life, I summoned death in my own. I now see things a lot clearer than before: I decide for myself to choose life. In all these feeble attempts to make her regain the trust in herself and rebuild the joy of living inside her wonderful, deeply intelligent and magnificently creative head, I, myself, fell for the poisonous traps that distort the soul. In a certain way I've become exactly like her, but I can deeply sense that this is not my destiny. Maybe someday my life force will be radiant enough to nurture her, as well as me, but right now we're both surviving from a dying light. This is the last chance to escape this sinking ship. If I can't save her, I can at least save myself."", I quietly thought to myself as I looked out of my window, being in awe while seeing a wonderful forest  touched by the delicate light of the sunset.

Just as I acknowledged this beautiful scenery, the sun hid behind the horizon and everything that was once so marvelous drowned in a grey shadow of homogenity. The emotional purge has run its course and I'm back to normal. All of that which I described has happened before dozens of times. ""My sister must come home soon, I wonder how her day was. I really hope she's okay.."", I asked myself while slightly amazed at the sight of a clock signalling almost four hours have passed while writing this story. I planned to work on my thesis and yet I'm here contemplating my whole life.

""Will things ever change?"", I truthfully asked myself. I sat in stillness for a brief moment. Moments like these are rare if your whole life revolves around running from a force that is so much greater than oneself. But even the most furious storms carry moments of calm. There's nothing in life that compares to the bliss felt in moments of deep quietness. Right then, I heard the crackling keys letting in my sister into our home. ""I'm back!"", she shouted in a voice that felt both quirkily cheerful and exhausted. I put on the smile that I always put on to make her feel welcomed. It is an honest smile that reflects my gratitude for her being alive, but it behind it lies so much suffering that it feels like a mask nowadays.

""Welcome back, I'm happy that you're here! How was your day?"", I exclaimed while mentally preparing for any incidents. It took merely a few seconds to see the lessons I learned and the conclusions I came to quietly fading into the back of my mind.  ""Good."", she said, ""My day was good"".

Could this symptom be caused by anorexia or is it just dry eyes?,"Both yesterday morning and today, the room felt like it was spinning as soon as I woke up (literally just opened my eyes). I guess it was dizziness? But it only lasted for 1-2 seconds and then went away. I've never felt dizzy before, except when drunk.

Also, in the middle of the night last night, I woke up and my vision was slightly blurry. Lasted maybe 20 minutes and then went away.

I don't know if this is caused by anorexia?? Or if I just have dry eyes? My eyes have been feeling really dry ever since I woke up in the middle of the night last night. I stare at my phone for like 12 hours a day, so maybe it's from that??",16q3h77,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16q3h77/could_this_symptom_be_caused_by_anorexia_or_is_it/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-23 12:38:42

Everybody's been noticing my weight gain,"Everybody is saying now that I look ""so healthy"" and ""so much better"" because it's very obvious I've gained weight since I stopped doing drugs about two months ago... and it's killing me. I'm sure we can all agree that us people with EDs don't like to be told we ""look healthy"" because our goal is to look practically unhealthily skinny, right? Or at least that's my goal...

This is so triggering. I've been so triggered for weeks now. I feel like I'll never lose this weight and I'll just keep gaining and gaining until I'm what I perceive on myself to be ""fat.""  I'm so scared. I feel like this is the beginning of the end for me in a way. I feel like I'll never have the body I'm content with again.

Relapse after 2 Years.,"TW: Drug Use mention, **No Numbers**, General Relapse thoughts

Hi all- looking for some support and insight. 

I was in genuine, real recovery for 2 whole years. Healthy weight, regular exercise, feeling good. I never counted calories and simply paid attention to serving sizes the ""appropriate"" amount. I weighed myself regularly but with a healthy mindset (Daily weigh-ins have been incredibly effective ERP for me). Truly no real disordered thoughts other than average self management and what I would consider normal body image concerns/ideas. 

Well somewhere along the way I got addicted to drugs. Rode that out, now we're 140+ days clean/sober.  

Cut to 3 weeks ago when suddenly I can't eat shit. Since then, AN is back full force. 

I KNOW this is all about control. I know I feel out of control in my life and needing to be sober. I get it. I think my body looks great at a healthy size and that my current fixation is truly just decorative icing for my brain. I don't *need* to look sick but I *want* to again.

How do I get back to recovery now that the switch got flipped? I don't really want to deal with my addiction thoughts and AN helps them go away.  

Any thoughts or advice? I hate that I've jumped back into this hell, but I clearly don't want to stop yet. 

**TL;DR:** Relapsed after 2 years of true recovery because I'm sober now. Let me know any thoughts or encouragement.  ",16pdl2l,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16pdl2l/relapse_after_2_years/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-22 15:41:48
Can't even tell when I'm hungry anymore,"Was pretty heavily disordered and underweight and recently I've been steadily gaining weight which makes me feel like shit, trying really hard to lose the extra 15 pounds I've gained without relapsing but it's impossible. The worst part is I can't even tell when im actually hungry anymore. I have an intense oral fixation and i legitimately never know if im hungry. But i never feel satisfied after eating, always worse. I used to get so hungry I'd get lightheaded, now I never feel hunger or lightheadedness, just a constant longing for food. I don't know how to get out of this cycle.

Eating makes me feel terrible,"I'm in recovery and as I'm eating more I feel that after I eat, I feel terrible, not emotionally (there is that but that's not what I'm talking about), but physically. I just feel bloated and I get stomach aches so often after I eat, especially if I eat ""too much"" (which isn't even a lot, like, a normal portion of food). For a few hours after I eat, I get this feeling every few minutes or so that something is travelling up my throat, and then it feels like it just bursts at the end of my throat before it would enter my mouth. It's almost like a burp, except there's no burp. Tied with this, I also get this lingering feeling that something is stuck in my throat, either at the top of it, or down in my chest. I'm trying to eat more, but why does my body have to make me feel terrible after eating?

I think I‚Äôm developing AFRID and idk what to do‚Ä¶,"I know this is kinda common, this is a bit messy but idk how to fully explain it. I‚Äôve always been a bit weird with certain foods, mainly meat (pork and chicken esp), but in the past year or so since I‚Äôve been trying to eat better (not really managed it but I‚Äôm not like actively starving myself if that makes sense?), but I feel like I give myself every excuse under the sun not to eat. I can barely eat any food anyone else cooks for me. If something smells slightly off at any point in the cooking process, it won‚Äôt get eaten. Any slight doubt I have while preparing it and I can‚Äôt eat it (although I feel like I‚Äôve picked that up from my mother as she‚Äôs always done that too, she‚Äôll just convince herself there‚Äôs something wrong to the point she makes herself sick so she just won‚Äôt eat anything if she‚Äôs felt slightly off about it at any point). I think because of her being like that I haven‚Äôt necessarily noticed this creeping up on me. 

I can almost never eat eggs anymore because the smell makes me too sick, 99% of butters taste vile to me and make me gag because they taste too buttery, if the consistency of anything is slightly off I can‚Äôt touch it. It‚Äôs honestly so bad when it comes to other peoples cooking, last year at Christmas all I could eat was the frozen Yorkshire puddings my bfs mum made, everything else I gave myself a reason I couldn‚Äôt eat. 

The reason why I feel like I can‚Äôt eat any of this stuff is because I believe it will make me sick, like I‚Äôll put it in my mouth and gag and it‚Äôll just put my off my food so I just don‚Äôt bother. I need help and I‚Äôm stuck on a doc waiting list, but I‚Äôm trying so hard to recover but I just can‚Äôt eat anything‚Ä¶ all I want to do is eat and gain weight, I‚Äôve fought so hard for this mindset and it‚Äôs still not enough",16oug7x,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16oug7x/i_think_im_developing_afrid_and_idk_what_to_do/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-21 23:09:27
why do many people with eating disorders hate EDTWT?,"Before I say anything, I am not the best in English so I might not explain/articulate my point of view well.

I have stumbled many times over the sub-twitter myself and was a lurker for some time after learning that many people considered it a very harmful and toxic community. I, personally, first had the impression that - yes it was a generally harmful community as it promotes anorexia and bulimia, even advice on taking diets with too low calories and doing fasts for an extended period of time. But when looking through a bit more, it is nowhere as harmful as people make it to, and the people are not as toxic as I've seen. In fact, considering what the topic is, they seem to be very supportive of each other and are filled with memes rather than the triggering advice they are sharing. Filled with body checks and OMADs it is, but every body check with a dangerously low weight is filled with comments such as wishing them to stay safe and even consider raising their so-called goal weight.
Have I perhaps not seen enough of the sub-twitter to judge it? I understand that for many non-disorders people, it seems unreal and strange to see an illness displayed like this - but what about disordered people? Why do many of them hate EDTWT that much? Many sub-twitters have vile sides and people but does this side have that many to be considered that awful?",16ou4cw,14,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16ou4cw/why_do_many_people_with_eating_disorders_hate/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-21 22:55:02

ED kind of making me embarrassed about my race,"So most the media representation of people with EDs, especially AN, has been white girls and being in disordered spaces for awhile I‚Äôve realized that most the people I‚Äôve seen are white too. This made me curious so I looked up the statistics for EDs in nonwhite people (specifically black because that‚Äôs what I am) and the results were pretty triggering. 

The [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2882704/) is kind of outdated but it said AN is the rarest ED in black people and the most common is binge eating. 

I know this doesn‚Äôt mean that no black person can or does have AN but it still so triggering. It makes me feel like maybe I‚Äôm a fraud and not actually disordered at all. It also reminds me of when someone was suspicious about my eating habits but told me I can‚Äôt get an eating disorder because they‚Äôre ‚Äúwhite people problems‚Äù. 

I feel stupid. There have been many times I‚Äôve questioned whether I‚Äôm actually sick or not and before I thought it could just be my disorder telling me I‚Äôm not disordered but now I‚Äôm faced with actual facts about how it‚Äôs almost impossible for someone like me to have AN and now I feel like I‚Äôve been lying to myself while on some diet this whole time. 

On top of that I feel guilty and extra dumb for being embarrassed about my race at all!

"‚ÄùWow, you really stuffed your face‚Äú","TRIGGER WARNING! (discussion of body image, self-hatred, ED behaviors and thoughts)

I got triggered really badly half an hour ago. My mental health worker came to visit me in my apartment and we usually get along really well. He‚Äôs more of a ‚Äùfriend‚Äú than a professional and we talk a lot about random stuff when his task is actually to help me with daily chores. I have other mental illnesses as well, that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs there to help me. I do those chores all by myself though because I feel too lazy when someone helps me, so we usually just talk. 

Today we talked about politics. I have a huge problem eating in front of others, but I challenged myself and ate some snacks. I couldn‚Äôt focus on the conversation anymore as I was thinking about the calories I just ate. It wasn‚Äôt even a lot, but I felt guilty and ashamed. 

My mental health worker then commented what I put in the title and it made me feel awful. I was on the verge of starting to hysterically cry about his comment. I felt so fat and disgusting. He knows about my eating disorder yet he still made that comment. Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. 

I had actually planned to eat some more, but now I can‚Äôt. My brain is telling me to go on a run and then go back to sleep so that I don‚Äôt eat anything. 

I felt so extremely hungry the last few days. It‚Äôs like NOTHING can take away the hunger. I literally ate ten times more than usual the last week. I felt horrible about it and body checked a lot in the mirror, crying almost every time while doing so. 

I hate my body, and I hate this illness. Just a few weeks ago everybody told me how worried they are and how bad I look and now no one seems to be worried anymore. My weight didn‚Äôt even change, but somehow I seem healthy enough now to everyone. At least that‚Äôs what my brain is telling me, because why else would someone comment that? And why would no one talk to me about my body anymore? Not that I want that, I actually hate it, but it somehow also gives me ED-brain the confirmation that I am almost sick enough.

This comment today came on top of all that. I feel so disgusting and alone right now, and I can‚Äôt stop punishing and insulting myself in my head. 

Looking in the mirror, I see myself even chubbier than before. I really don‚Äôt know what to do and I wanted to share my thoughts with someone because I am alone in my apartment and I have no one to talk to besides my boyfriend who is at work right now and my mom who‚Äôs in the hospital at the moment because she‚Äôs really sick again.

I've gained only 5 pounds since I stopped doing drugs consistently (about two months ago) but it makes such a difference in my appearance, I constantly feel like I have a double chin and my arms are getting fat and my stomach is getting pudgy.

May spark unhealthy mindset but genuine question,"I (18F) got diagnosed w ~~Anorexia~~ almost a year ago and since then I have been in residential treatment and it has not worked. I keep up going up and down with my weight and mindset but I went back to college for my sophomore year a while ago which has helped me since I don't have anyone micromanaging everything I do. Right now I do have a dietician and therapist but sometimes I find it more difficult when they try to talk to me about certain things. I know that I am still young but the only thing I can think of helping me recover in anyway is just thinking about gaining weight so I can get ~~liposuction~~ in my stomach (the insecurity that started my whole ED) I know that is still a very disordered mindset in order to recover but 1. I have the money to pay for it fully myself and 2. i hate the way my face and everything else looks now but the only thing thats keeping my ED going is the extreme issue i have with my mindset around my stomach area. I understand that it is also about confidence and finding comfort in my body, ive heard it all lol but this specifically is what has had me in an eating disordered cycle for the past seven years. I want to move on and eat freely without thinking about my disorder forever and this is the best conclusion I came to",16nvxw6,10,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16nvxw6/may_spark_unhealthy_mindset_but_genuine_question/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-20 20:43:06
I'm obsessing over making deviled eggs.,"I'm not officially diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, but I definitely do have bad body image issues and I don't consistently eat because of that factor and may others. I really badly want to experience tasting deviled eggs but I'm afraid that the yolk is too unhealthy and I'm kind of anxious about it. I haven't eaten in several hours, and I really want to try this dish, but I'm really worried that it's going to makee gain weight or highten cholesterol (my cholesterol levels aren't bad). Could someone maybe help me think clearly on this issue?

"I hate that I‚Äôm getting bad again, and I hate how much of a liar it makes me","I‚Äôve been maintaining and like borderline-in recovery for a bit now. And I‚Äôm so close to my psych degree while also working 40+ hours a week at a group home for adult men with IDD/ASD. I can‚Äôt afford to get bad again, and  returning to treatment is in no way an option.
I was assaulted by one of the residents on Monday and had to go to the ER and am now on bedrest/workman‚Äôs comp (bulging discs and hernias in the spine due to the impact). And since I can‚Äôt get out of bed, I really having trouble justifying any sort of intake. Like cuz I‚Äôm not really moving, I feel so stressed consuming any amount of calories. Anyway, I live with my partner and he knows I haven‚Äôt been eating again. He called me from work during his break today and made me promise to eat something. So I sent him a snap of me and some food, then immediately flushed it down the toilet so it looks like I ate and he will never know.
I hate lying. Especially to the person I love most in the world. ESPECIALLY since I know he‚Äôs right and he‚Äôs just trying to love and support me, to take care of me.  But I have this inner monologue that won‚Äôt stfu. It‚Äôs almost like I won‚Äôt let myself fully recover because I still don‚Äôt believe my disorder is that bad.

i tried getting my mom to realize that i'm losing weight and having issues (such as aching, dizziness, gerd, etc.) and she's just like, ""well idk what your problem is"" i don't want to die from this illness, is it already too late? i don't think that it is my the overthinking part of my brain says the opposite :(",16nmczz,20,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16nmczz/apparently_im_just_blind_to_it/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-20 14:13:59
i‚Äôm really struggling right now,"i was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at the age of 12. i‚Äôm 22 now and (finally) weight restored. recovery has gone decently so far (i just made it to the 7 month mark a few days ago!), but i‚Äôm scared that this won‚Äôt be the last time i‚Äôll have to go through this. i‚Äôve been weary about it since i was admitted to the hospital last fall, to be quite honest.
over the last couple of months, i‚Äôve noticed this really intense paranoia creeping up on me when i think about the weight i‚Äôve gained back so far. it has become more and more tempting to give into the taunting little voice in my head that tries persistently to rationalise relapsing again.
it‚Äôs often hard as hell to get through those periods, but.. sometimes i picture younger me, this little, innocent little boy who dreamed of being invisible, of taking up as little space as possible. no child deserves to feel like that. not a single one. i‚Äôm fucking starting to cry as i write this.
when i began my most recent round of treatment for my eating disorder, i told my therapist that i was ‚Äúdoing this for little me.‚Äù and i meant it, because that little boy doesn‚Äôt deserve to die.

idk i‚Äôm just in a really confusing place with everything right now. i‚Äôm bipolar and currently in a depressive episode. every time i begin overthinking, which is pretty often, my brain is telling me not to just restrict, but to starve myself so i can just die.

i have permanent health issues from a decade of anorexia and each year, i‚Äôm at a higher and higher risk of dying from this disease.

i‚Äôm tired and scared and i need a hug idk man.",16ng56v,5,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16ng56v/im_really_struggling_right_now/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-20 08:45:11
I'm so tired of being screwed over by psychiatry,"So for context i live in a rural area with minimal MH options and I live too far from my previous ones to utilise them, which has led me to begin the fucking painful journey of getting a new care team.

My bloods are abnormal, my weight/bmi is low (and getting worse) i'm having shitty health complications and I've been triaged to the highest ability of doctors, nurse practitioners and general health services without being sent to IP. However, the fucking psychologist (who is the only one who's qualified in EDs) doesn't do meetings without a phone assessment first. She is in the office one day a week! A singular day! I have referrals from multiple places and yet i have to play catch up with her and she's never there or busy with another client and I'm so tired. She is the only one that can give me the services i need but i just feel so dejected because she's only ever called when I'm in another appointment with someone else , even the she knows the fucking times.

The NP is concerned, Dr is concerned but like the one person who can actually help isn't. Like i know it's not entirely her fault but i just feel like im being avoided cause I'm not sick enough and she doesn't think i am. At this point the rest of the care team are tempted to try to send me to IP just so I'll have better care but that's the extreme case (even though i do qualify for it). 

I just want to get worse and I'm tired of trying - pushing myself to go to every appointment just for the main actual chance for psychiatric help is not there.

Edit for some extra context: to be sent to IP i would have to be sent over an hour from where i live and to move through this quicker, i would have to have private health insurance - which i can't afford so this is really all i have access to currently.",16nbsao,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16nbsao/im_so_tired_of_being_screwed_over_by_psychiatry/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-20 04:18:57
Does anybody else get heart palpitations,"For the past two years or so I get random heart palpitations, usually when I‚Äôm going uphill or doing some exercise but sometimes when I‚Äôm not.

It was a little hard to sleep last night because I was getting them every few seconds, then it would go away, then come back. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôll just go away or back to a normal amount when the vaccine side effects wear off so I told myself not to worry. I never had heart palpitations before I developed my eating disorder.

I took the rec dose yesterday and nothing, and then this morning and got wildly nausous and stomach cramps. Im so physically uncomfortable but thank you god not genuinely in pain.

When should you start challenging fear foods in recovery?,"I've just started my recovery journey after months of being too scared.

  
I had a wakeup call tonight when the doctor said I had two options: admission with NG tube or I do this myself and choose what I eat, as long as I hit the calories. My weight will be updated weekly and if I go any lower i'll immediately be admitted.

  
I want to do this, I want to try and hold myself accountable and hit my calorie goal, despite currently being on an exercise ban. I'm exhausted and I don't want to live like this anymore. 

  
My diet is currently restrictive, but I am trying to hit the calories. I have a lot of fear foods / foods that I avoid. I don't feel comfortable eating these yet, especially in big quantities, but I am open to the idea of challenging a fear food once a week or one every few weeks.

  
When do you think is the right time to do this, or should I be doing this currently?

what if i just let it,"after 3 long years of fighting off the voices and urges, coming close to relapse, and then making strides in recovery.... it's happening again.

it's been a week. i feel so empty. literally. i keep telling myself i wont eat until things get better, but i secretly hope they don't. i just want the voices to take me already. im so tired of fighting.

i dont know. can succumbing to this really be that bad? i know life has its ups and downs and maybe theres another few good days left ahead for me... but are they really worth fighting for? it's been so long since ive been happy i can't remember the last time. 

i went through my last recovery alone. of course people noticed the dramatic weight loss but nobody cared. i was dying right in front of them and nobody cared. i felt so pathetic and just wanted to prove to myself that i was strong. i dont think i can do that again.. not without actual physical help.

im very grateful when i can get words of encouragement online when i can, but that can only go so far. i think i need someone to physically shovel dirt in my mouth.

i wonder how long it will take. maybe i should lay myself out on the public bench that way someone calls emergency services when things start to rot. 

i said i felt pathetic a few sentences ago but i dont think id even leave a note if things got bad, as if people need an explanation. maybe i deserve this. i'll stop here, my thoughts arent making sense even to me now.",16mgczb,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16mgczb/what_if_i_just_let_it/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-19 03:38:46

But i can tell my clothes aren't fitting like they were just a few weeks ago. When i get sick, it triggers ED thoughts that normally i can ignore until i feel better and then get back on track with intake. But now i feel stuck again. Stuck in this weird mindset that i need to restrict even when i start feeling better. My brain wants me sucked back into the endless loop of my ED. I keep trying to not let this get to me. But clearly it seems to already have been doing so. I see my therapist tomorrow but i am so ashamed and so embarrassed that i have this mentality just because i went through all this nausea and finding food unappetizing. I don't want to let anyone down. But i now hust feel compelled to lose as much as i can.",16m1l14,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16m1l14/i_dont_know_what_to_do_now/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-18 17:25:32
I‚Äôve slipped back to my old habits very quickly,"I could somewhat see it coming but I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm scared.

I was okay with my weight. Then suddenly I wasn‚Äôt. I think with maintenance for months or the perceived inability to lose perhaps? it triggered things. Now I feel like I did before my last bad restriction period about my body, so I know it can easily be very dangerous and very quickly.

Part of it is likely also wanting control as I‚Äôm stressed out a lot. Upcoming due dates I think played a role.

Further, due to my hormonal cycle (no period though) I often have no appetite for a couple days and more of an appetite or more cravings then usual. I don‚Äôt engage in binging or anything but do try to allow myself leniency in the foods I eat during this time. For example, if this is the first time all year I‚Äôve wanted chocolate milk, I‚Äôll let myself have some.

I‚Äôm just scared

Part of me is also scared about what if I do get that period of an appetite, except it‚Äôs not coming and I don‚Äôt think it is. I just lost mostly all of my appetite almost overnight.

I won‚Äôt even drink water when I‚Äôm thirsty and drink very little.

I‚Äôm worried about my doctors appointment, which worsens my behaviours/thoughts/feelings knowing I will get weighed. But I also have an event this week. So as much as I want to fight it I also want to keep going as I always try to be as skinniest as possible for things.

I‚Äôm already having physical effects and I really fear the future. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I tried buying some things like apples as I saw a cool thing on tiktok but can‚Äôt even touch them.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm in school so I can‚Äôt just ‚Äúget treatment‚Äù and have avoided it in the past even if it meant gaining weight. My disorder however is too bad that anything besides inpatient will not work with me. Yet I have effectively been able to run from inpatient through gaining weight and lying I was doing better a while back (which triggered insane restriction which fucked my heart and digestive system) and avoiding doctors. 

Part of me wants help but I can‚Äôt with school and everything else.

Should I wait till after the event maybe? See if that enables me to be able to eat more?

I was thinking also maybe reach out to a friend and say if its bad in a week to encourage help or something but that feels dumb and wrong and immature and attention seeking. I don‚Äôt entirely hide things and they know I‚Äôve been struggling the past few days, I just worry about if I slip.

My anxiety is also so bad because money is tight that despite having at least a month of food, I wish to starve myself so over the next couple months when I‚Äôm broke I‚Äôll have food. Some of it is illogical and past trauma and just the way I tend to be wired now, but some of it is logical. I‚Äôm to embarrassed to ever discuss it with anyone though.

I can‚Äôt even afford some of the out of pocket tests I need from the past restriction damage so I definitely can‚Äôt afford to redo my schooling etc.

friend venting ab ed,"tldr; my plus friend kinda triggered me; and now i feel like a dick for having an ed

i probably told my friend i had an eating disorder at one point. i don‚Äôt remember directly telling her but i‚Äôve definitely mentioned it. now, she is plus size and i‚Äôm not. i‚Äôve never called myself fat in front of her or talked about wanting to lose weight, i‚Äôve only talked ab the self-harm part of it if asked not the weight part (even though she probably knows it‚Äôs ab weight). recently i‚Äôve started to relapse, on and off, issues w my dad and school starting and i‚Äôm gonna be 20 which is terrifying, but i‚Äôm falling back into old patterns. 

now- the story. my friend also has an ed. i sent her a tik tok on the new ice spice drink and how caloric it is and alternatives to the drink and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs split it‚Äù. honestly i wasn‚Äôt thinking about the calories or anything disordered, just that it‚Äôs a lot in a drink and we should split it. she then asked me why i was thinking about weight loss, i said i wasn‚Äôt this was just the tik tok that came up on my fyp ab the drink. then she goes into a vent/joke about her ed and how she doesn‚Äôt eat and she‚Äôs lost xx lbs. i don‚Äôt know what to say so i just tell her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do it that hurts‚Äù (bc i can‚Äôt comfort ppl, i just joke and usually that‚Äôs enough for ppl to feel betterüò≠) -fast forward, i‚Äôm one my break at work same day and she comes and brings me a medium of the drink. i tell her to try it, and she refuses. we talk more ab calories and im just thinking ‚Äúif i don‚Äôt drink this im a dick but if i do i literally am going to want to kms‚Äù so i did, she eventually left and i threw like half of it out. but bc of that conversation i skipped my daily iced coffee, just for her to bring me a drink w way more calories and not even any coffee. now i want to kms. and after work, we hung out and got dinner and i ended up eating more then her because i didn‚Äôt want her to feel bad about eating. but now i feel awful, mentally and physically bc why do i hate my body? i think my friend is beautiful, but if she ever knew that i hate my body how would she feel about herself? what if she already knows which she probably does anyway",16lexi5,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16lexi5/friend_venting_ab_ed/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-17 22:59:58

I don‚Äôt know what to do,I live in Germany. I live with flat mates paid by child support. My caretakers knew I suffer from anorexia. Because I started to recover in the beginning of the year they left me alone with it and let me move in again. 2 months ago I started to fall into my ed again and they could tell by now. They told me I have to try to recover or they‚Äôll put me into psych ward if my weight gets dangerous again. I‚Äôm really scared because I was just in clinic in the beginning of the year and I‚Äôd have to start the school year again. I rationally know that it would be the right thing to try so I can stay home and go to school because I‚Äôm really motivated to go to school. But I really don‚Äôt want to recover. I could move to a place paid by social support so no one can stop me. I told my caretaker but she said that it isn‚Äôt the solution because if I continue I‚Äôm going to be dead in a year.

Feeling worthy‚Ä¶ (TW),"I don‚Äôt know why I feel the way I do. Probably to do with a bunch of unhealthy conditioning from‚Ä¶ nvm‚Ä¶ not worth rehashing‚Ä¶.

It just hurts so much because in a lot of ways, we were in the same position. It‚Äôs soooo hard sometimes to feel worthy of food. That putting much needed calories into my body is something that I am worthy of. It‚Äôs so tiring to fight every day when all I see is everyone else not having to deal with it(outwardly anyway). Her partner helps her recover and I wish it were that easy. To just have someone make me say I‚Äôm worthy every day and make it feel true. I‚Äôm just lost.

My parents trigger my disorder,"Tw for depression, suicide, and transphobia. I apologize if this seems disjointed. It's also very long. I'm still making sense of my illness, and my past, and I really can't get it all to flow neatly. But, I want to get it out there, because I desperately need advice. And maybe some sympathy for others who have to deal with this awful disorder.

I have anorexia, and I'm a transgender woman. For as long as I can remember, my parents have commented negatively on my body, weight, and eating habits. I remember the first time I starved myself, I was about 5 years old. As a little chubby kid, I felt incredibly ashamed of my body, and through this, I managed to make myself skinny, and retain my thinness my whole life. Thinking about this still causes me a lot of pain.

Even as a kid, I wasn't able to talk about any of my feelings with my parents. If I tried to, or if I lost control of my emotions, it upset them both so much that I had to console them and tell them that I was okay even if I wasn't. The only time that I was allowed to not be okay was when I was sick. I guess I realized this a little later, when I was about 10, and exploited it occasionally by faking sickness when I was too upset or lonely for me alone to handle. I think that this might've been why hunger, and the bodily weakness it caused me, started to make me feel secure. I ate even less throughout puberty, as the bodily changes I was experiencing frightened and disgusted me. Hunger was my recourse. I had always felt like I should've been born a girl, but I also didn't think that I could share this with anyone. To me, ignorant of the existence of  trangender people, it seemed like I was suffering under a delusion, and should do my best to forget about it.

I made it through school okay, with good grades and friends, but toward the end of highschool I became extremely depressed. I started having seizures. I was suicidal. My mind seemed to come and go along with my self-control, and I was unable to keep up my carefully crafted facade around them. My parents then, got meaner and meaner. I thought that they were afraid I would become a failure to thrive adult, and that maybe this scared them because that would mean that they had also failed me. So, I tried to get help. I told them about my depression, and after some months, I convinced them to let me see a therapist. I got on antidepressants, but as soon as I started to feel better, my dad began telling me how emotionless I was. How I was a zombie due to those antidepressants. I resented this, and knew that i was healing, but he kept saying it. It made me sick to my stomach knowing that he felt cut-off from me. So I stopped them after a while.

Years later, I came out to them as transgender. They seemed to accept it at first, which made me happier than I'd felt in a while. It seemed like they were finally going to accept all of me, all of my feelings, and that I was finally going to be able to be myself. But about a week later, I came home late at night from a day of school followed by work to find my dad sitting in the dark in my living room. The tv was off, which I thought was strange. Since he was doing nothing, I guessed he had been waiting for me, sat down beside him, and looked at him. He had this grim look on his face, and was staring straight ahead at nothing. I had a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach, and asked him what was going on. Then, he exploded. Body language was wild, huge, rapid, abrupt gestures, he started yelling at me, telling me that me being transgender was stupid, that someone had to have ""done this to me"", since I didn't show any signs of it. I didn't say anything, just clenched my fists, trying to hold back tears and anger. It culminated in me leaving the house, yelling ""fuck off!"" Or something like that, and leaving. I wasn't welcome back. Stayed with friends until I could afford to move somewhere.

I'm going to skip ahead to today since I think I've given a pretty clear representation of my relationship with my parents.

It's only been a month or two since I started trying to increase my food intake, fix the bad thought patterns, and get better from anorexia. I also tried to cut all contact with my parents. This was successful for a while, however, my parents have been wanting to see me again, and it seems like they'll do anything to make sure I stay in contact with them. Anything except change or look at themselves and our relationship. They said they accept me and my being trans, but they refuse to use my new name or pronouns. I've been on hormones for two years now. They still comment on my body, and eating habits, only now there's some weird tranmisogyny in the mix as well. Whenever they demand to see me, or call me or text me, I want to starve myself. For many reasons, I wish to cut contact with them, but they will not accept this. I feel scared and alone and hurt. My body is weak, (i just lost my manual labor job due to this), my seizures came back, and my mind is going once again. I just can't figure out what to do.",16ke702,10,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16ke702/my_parents_trigger_my_disorder/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-16 18:17:50

My parents don't want to call an ambulance although experts say it's the only thing that could save my life,"Hello everyone,
as the title says my psychologist called my parents today to talk to them. She said that at this point I'm not getting better by myself and although my parents try to help me it's not enough and I need to get recovered in a specialized center for anorexia after a brief permanence in a hospital. She told them to call an ambulance asap and get myself in. My parents sounded ok with all of this saying they will call an ambulance and try to get me help. However as soon as they ended the call they said they won't and told me to go to a different psychologist. Now, I am twenty years old and could call an ambulance myself and do everything that my psychologist told me to do. But I'm afraid to go against their will and create more problems. Currently (I know that this type of talk is not allowed but I have to get you a general idea of my condition to get opinions on whether I should or should not get recovered) my health plummeted although I look pretty healthy (even though people can tell that I have an ed).

I feel like like my thought process is disordered b I also feel like a wanna berexic T . T ill initiative fasts and maybe follow through for 2 days and give up while other ‚Äúreal‚Äù anorexics will fast for days. 

I don‚Äôt even want to be anorexic b I can just find out if I‚Äôm disordered I‚Äôll be actually able to deal with the issue more efficiently bc right now I‚Äôve been sort of gaslighting myself into ‚Äúliking food‚Äù and eating more in the sake of ‚Äúnot being disordered‚Äù

I gained like what 10 lbs in 2 weeks or so not even two weeks it literally just came on overnight and is not going so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up‚Ä¶. And I will literally be on the verge of tears over weight gain and wanna starve and just spiral basically. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a normal response or not though. 

I have spaces and time periods where I won‚Äôt eat and when I was like 7 I told my mom I didn‚Äôt want to eat bc I wanted to be skinny like the models.. I‚Äôve always been skinnier but I‚Äôve never been the one to splurge or binge on food usually. The only reason I gained so much weight is because college has so many options and I think I went over board as in i basically fucking binged. And I‚Äôm so üò≠ I‚Äôm so upset with myself. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs non disordered and I‚Äôm just holding myself accountable or the anger is coming from being disordered but I don‚Äôt wanna eat anymore and I‚Äôm honestly probably going to do a week fast or sowmthing or just try to regulate my eating. AHHH I don‚Äôt know but I genuinely want to die rn. 

I used to workout after every meal in the summer time and I used to get into ketosis like daily naturally. But yeah now I feel like disgusting this is genuinely the highest weight I‚Äôve ever been üò≠ even though it‚Äôs healthy weight I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 135 I‚Äôve always just had a desire to be underweight @ bmi 18 or bmi 15 at the lowest. My goal is to be 110 lbs honestly or 85 at the lowest. But I feel like I have these goals but I don‚Äôt actively pursue them like diagnosed anorexics so.

I hate the feeling of being full, I wish I could never eat if I didn‚Äôt have to and I wish I could genuinely photosynthesize. I‚Äôm really scared bc I know is easier to gain weight than it is to lose it and I don‚Äôt wanna hold on to this 10lbs foreverüòî I‚Äôd prefer to be disordered so I can find a way to go around fixing this than just be someone who wants to be skinny but I have no clue what traits I exhibit.",16jxfpo,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16jxfpo/am_i_even_disordered/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-16 03:46:08

I was in hospital 3 times and inpatient for 6months twice. I got out 3months ago and relapsed because my therapist (also FP) left and never answered my mails again.

I don‚Äôt have anyone and no new therapist and I‚Äôm struggling so bad. I‚Äôm exhausted and don‚Äôt now what to do. I‚Äôm doing my a levels rn and I can‚Äôt handle anything right now. 
I got a new teacher this year and I really like her and asked her if she can spare 10minutes after our next lesson. 

obviously I‚Äôm gonna respect her boundaries etc. but I literally don‚Äôt have anyone and I just can‚Äôt exist like this. recovery would strain me even more as Anorexia is really a compensation for other problems.

do you think I could just confide in her? I‚Äôd she‚Äôs alright with that, I‚Äôm gonna ask.
but ideas on what I could say so I don‚Äôt sound completely weird. I‚Äôm just so done and really need someone rn. And I‚Äôm really specific on who I want to trust. 

please help me out I‚Äôm really stressing out over this as I don‚Äôt want to be annoying but I thought a teacher at least is a person you can confide in as they‚Äôre somewhat trained to do so.

how can I start and she knows nothing about me so how can I say something. like I said I don‚Äôt want to be weird but I can‚Äôt manage rn.",16jo8wm,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16jo8wm/talking_to_a_teacher_about_ed/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-15 20:41:26
Struggling not to relapse,"This is gonna be pretty triggering bc it includes someone being fatphobiv

Important context: I‚Äôve been bouncing between BED and Anorexia for most of my life. I‚Äôm currently in partial recovery from both thankfully as I‚Äôm neither binging or restricting for the first time in like half a decade. I‚Äôm 16, and overweight. I am transgender, ftm but still at an all girls school

I‚Äôve recently started my Alevels and since i went to an all girls school for secondary and my Anorexia wasn‚Äôt too bad for a while after I transitioned because there were very few goal weight men in my life. 

Now the sixth form is opened up to boys, and I‚Äôve now got at least one boy who looks how i want to look in every class, friendship group, everything. Because of this, I‚Äôve started doing fasting periods. 

But recently (like today) a new student called me fat, to my face, and told me to start exercising. This made me feel terrible and I‚Äôm really struggling to continue with recovery. I normally cope with these feelings with triple digit limits and ridiculous fasting periods with over exercise. 

I‚Äôm physically disabled, and i can‚Äôt do my restrictions and manage my health/school concerns. I know myself and know if I start I will spiral and won‚Äôt be able to stop, but I also cannot stop myself, cause being in school is just so triggering rn.

‚ÄúSoup as a meal is not a binge. Soup as a meal is not a binge. Soup as a meal is not a binge?‚Äù,"*tw restriction and bingeing*


I‚Äôve been awake, lost in media and insomnia for 48 hours straight. I had coffee with dairy and some sugars, though anything else that follows is firmly now branded a binge in my sickened mind I suppose? A snack of cucumber or tomato feels like a lie calorie-wise, especially if I‚Äôm breaking a fast, slim chance they‚Äôre as calorie friendly as the numbers claim they are, must be false information? Surely when you add the salt and pepper on top, that is when it becomes a meal. Now, the single meal a day I so graciously *grant* and fantasize over all day long feels enamoured in shame and anger as well? What‚Äôs worse is that one meal today was a very standard size of soup and diet cola. Immediately back on the scale, disgraced at the effect of sodium, though I‚Äôm still starving, disgusting. How did it happen like this? How did I become within this thinking? Why is this serpent so tightly constricted around my soul? No one in their right mental should *ever* feel the amount of pure loathing and fear I currently am over eating a can of soup and drinking a cup of coffee within a full day, it‚Äôs bizarre, when I type it‚Ä¶ But not one lullaby of soothe I sing to my psyche can convince myself that my soup wasn‚Äôt a full blown binge. Am I losing the plot? Did I binge? I‚Äôm so sorry if I sound like a lost and paranoid filled fool, just frozen with fear over what progress I lost.

Im unsure of what I‚Äôm losing within myself.",16j4qhq,7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16j4qhq/soup_as_a_meal_is_not_a_binge_soup_as_a_meal_is/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-15 05:32:56

Using my ed as an excuse for every mistake,"One reason why I don't want to give up my eating disorder right now is that I can use it as a cause for mistakes or stupid situations in everyday life. 

Did I fail an exam? This is due to my eating disorder (because illness and so on). 

Am I not getting something right? (had no energy for it because of the eating disorder).

 I always use it as an excuse for myself because I am mentally ill and I am strongly influenced by it. 

Sometimes more sometimes less. 

But basically, the eating disorder is a reason for every mistake in my life for now (even though my own stupidity or normal weaknesses might be the reason), so that I don't blame myself. 

There may be a little egoism there, but this mindset makes it easier for me to put up with stupid situations.

It's like escaping from unpleasant situations so that I realize ""Oh, it's all the eating disorder"" and it's not my fault. 

At the same time, I don't seek help and I can't admit guilt to myself.",16iu6ux,25,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16iu6ux/using_my_ed_as_an_excuse_for_every_mistake/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-14 21:15:52

I never told him I had an ED either! I struggle with it a lot when i'm on the healthy looking side, and have a constant fear of getting bigger, I love the feeling that I get when I'm skinny, like I can take over the world. I constantly body check and I have TONS of pics in my phone of me standing in the same place and same position so I can compare them side to side to check my weight, because the scale is my enemy.. I refuse to go on it.. I only have it because my fiance uses it. Does anyone else feel this way? Like you're at peace with how you handle your ED and see no need to ever want to get help?

"I can‚Äôt go back into recovery, i‚Äôm genuinely sick of looking at myself","I think I need to hear feedback on this because i‚Äôm too scared to tell anyone in my life right now. i am aware i have Anorexia Nervosa, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs making me ‚Äúsick‚Äù or has to be a horrible thing. I went to treatment in and out for a couple of years now and recently finished my treatment program. To be completely honest, I knew i was gonna try to lose weight when i left. I did everything i could to appear better and be able to leave and especially make things better with my family as they were very upset at how ‚Äúbad‚Äù things got. The thing though is that I don‚Äôt necessarily think having anorexia is a bad thing. I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs like a super power to be able to drop weight and not miss food. I miss being able to eat whatever I want and not fear gaining weight from it since I was already at my lowest weight.

I don‚Äôt plan on losing everything i gained, just enough to where I don‚Äôt hate looking at myself. I‚Äôve already lost a fair amount of weight and my family keeps trying to pressure me to weigh me and I don‚Äôt want to go back. I genuinely am at a place where I cannot stand looking at myself and I simply can‚Äôt go back somewhere where i got extremely big. I‚Äôve been thin my entire life and it‚Äôs normal for me but these people brainwashed my entire family into thinking if i lose a couple of pounds I need treatment again.

help with my friend,"Okay so my friend has had an eating disorder since she was a sophomore in high school and she is now a senior in college. She has had other health scares in the past with it such as a heart murmur. She has done out patient twice and in patient once to help solve it.
Nothing has clearly worked. Her weight fluctuates a lot given a few months difference. She is a heavy drinker (college student at #1 party school) and does coke. (she has recently became addicted to it over the summer even tho she has lost no weight from it) she throws up often when we are out, but you can never tell if it's from drinking or her ED. She has bulimia and anorexia. Usually you can tell when her ED is bad because she'll become very skinny but this time was a surprise. She doesn't listen to anyone and there's nothing we can really do. At this point, we all know she has one, but we just push it under the water. Recently over the weekend she went to the hospital because she was throwing up what looked like coffee grounds. She has a tear in her esophagus. She says she is stopping but I know she isn't. We go to different colleges and we try to talk to her about it and she has barely answered since Saturday. She left our gc (to be dramatic) and is clearly not getting help. She doesn't realize how serious this is AND HASNT TOLD HER PARENTS. What do you think I should do? I know her parents, but they are very odd people. I know they have the funds to send her to a treatment center, but I just don't know the best approach. The doctors literally told her she will die if she doesn't stop. Should I text her mom?

Night eating,"I have been kind of relapsing in my recovery. I am like 3 months into it and have gained quite a bit of weight. I began to pull back and slowly restrict.

Struggling so much with recovery. How do I stop feeling like this is permanent?,"I know recovery‚Äôs never linear but I just don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs never been this bad before. I‚Äôve dealt with EDs since I was a teenager and recently had the absolute most atrocious relapse into anorexia I‚Äôve ever had. I began focusing on recovery near the end of June when I started having health issues; I‚Äôve been putting in the work, genuinely trying so hard, but it‚Äôs just not sticking. The thought of food/calories/weight gain is essentially a fixture of my brain now, I can‚Äôt walk a single step or even think about eating without involuntarily tracking the calories burnt/eaten. I can‚Äôt stress enough how much I hate my ED and how badly I want to recover, there‚Äôs nothing glamorous about this for me. For the past 4 months, I‚Äôve either been painfully hungry or fighting the anxiety/guilt of having eaten. Constantly. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I stood up without my vision going black, I‚Äôm cold all the time, I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt focus. I haven‚Äôt had my period since July, my hair‚Äôs falling out, my teeth hurt, I had horrible bruising all over my legs and ankles up until a few weeks ago. I‚Äôm just exhausted. It affected me to the point of spending a whole month shut in after I finished undergrad because I could only get myself to eat every other day and my friends usually like to eat together when we hang out. I WANT to recover, so why can‚Äôt I?

It‚Äôs been so demoralizing and I‚Äôm worried I hit a breaking point yesterday. I had to get my body measured for something, which is bad enough in and of itself, and one of my friends made a joke about me freaking out if I was a single centimeter off from ‚Äúideal.‚Äù Followed by another joke about how if that happened, I‚Äôd probably blame it on this one thing I‚Äôd eaten that weekend. It hurt a bit since I actually got myself to eat full meals that weekend and I was rlly proud of that. What sucks is that he wasn‚Äôt trying to be hurtful, he actually wouldn‚Äôt have said it if he knew it would hit a nerve. This was his genuine commentary on the way I‚Äôm perceived. I‚Äôve made my mental illness such an integral part of me that it‚Äôs now normalized and seen as just a character trait. It made me realize all my recovery efforts from the last few months were just so insufficient, I‚Äôm still sick, I‚Äôm still so visibly and noticeably sick people can make jokes about it without it raising any red flags/being seen as unusual behaviors

I‚Äôm genuinely at a loss here, trying to stop feeling like I hit a point of no return and just can‚Äôt recover anymore. Is it possible that my brain and body are just permanently altered or something? I‚Äôm actively concerned about my health issues but my brain just won‚Äôt let me recover.

Finally seeking help but not taking it,"
TW 


So I m 19F almost 20 and I‚Äôve definitely had a range of Eds since I was 15. The primary one is anorexia and I‚Äôm in the worst ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù i quote it because I don‚Äôt feel I ever recovered mentally, just physically. This consciously started a lil over a month ago after a breakup triggered me to get bad again. 
For the first time I‚Äôm being 100% honestly with loved ones and professionals about what‚Äôs going on in my mind now that im an adult i just don‚Äôt feel the need to be so secret since I can‚Äôt be forced into treatment.
But now I have urgently been referred by my therapist (who doesn‚Äôt specialize in Ed‚Äôs) to different therapists and programs for assessments, due to concerns we both have about my very low heart rate. I‚Äôve also had such rapid weight loss.


So I got an assessment from ERC today and they suggest PHP. Im too scared to do it and I‚Äôve heard awful things about the place itself, plus it‚Äôs way too expensive.
Idk what to do because I don‚Äôt want this to kill me but I won‚Äôt let myself or my family pay thousands of dollars just to make me physically recover again.
Idk if im being stubborn but this is where im at and idk what to do, I‚Äôve never rlly wanted to recover like this
I know it sounds like ed talking when I deny PHP but I‚Äôm truly so horrified by what I hear that it‚Äôll just be a traumatizing experience, im very sensitive and know I won‚Äôt take well to impatience or people forcing me to eat every crumb of something idk.",16h7b1o,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16h7b1o/finally_seeking_help_but_not_taking_it/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-12 23:50:41

I think my psychologist is triggering me (need advice),"I've noticed her saying some things that don't really make sense. She says she worked in a psych ward with people with eating disorders. She said she had enough of it.
But she speaks as if she knew nothing about the disorder.
She told me her weight and how when she gains above a certain about she stops eating cake or whatever and bike's more, and when she's lower than that she eats some more.
She asked me why can't I just gain weight to a healthy amount and then basically just watch my weight so it doesn't surpass what I'm uncomfortable with.
It's like she doesn't understand at all.
She assumed my weight (lower than it really is). 
I know these aren't big issues but they are triggering for me, I think (I'm not good at recognizing that)
I don't wanna leave her but I don't think I can discuss eating disorder stuff with her. But isn't that a crucial part of the treatment?",16grana,41,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16grana/i_think_my_psychologist_is_triggering_me_need/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-12 13:23:14

Does anyone have advice on how to enjoy eating more in recovery?,"I've been in recovery for several years now, and I've made sooooo much progress! I've increased the amount of food I ate by a lot, quit excessive exercise and improved my health too. But the main problem is I have to force myself to eat most of the time. It's not that I don't have an appetite. If anything I'm still having some extreme hunger. But even when I'm hungry, I feel so much anxiety and dread around food. Every day I get hungry within 30 minutes of waking up, I make myself a quick bite to eat, and I think, ""ugh this is so frustrating that I have to eat breakfast."" Then I sit down to eat, I start feeling a lot of restless energy in my body, and I just have to get up out of my chair! It takes me forever to eat, and every bite of food either grosses me out or bores me.

can i still say i have anorexia even if i don‚Äôt fit the mould for it?,"firstly i want to say i‚Äôm really sorry if this is triggering in any way, it‚Äôs my first post so a but unfamiliar with everything haha 

also realised this is really long so just really the bottom part is most important i think?


anyways i‚Äôve suffered with my eating for years i want to say maybe 6 years on and off? maybe more? i was on a medication that took my hunger away (i didn‚Äôt take it for that reason) and i also had extreme emtaphobia (fear of throwing up) it got to a point i couldn‚Äôt eat foods unless i knew they couldn‚Äôt make me sick, and i wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell the difference between hunger and sickness. i would go ages without eating a lot, because i was terrified i‚Äôd be sick, i literally would beg my mom to help me and have extreme anxiety attacks when i felt slightly sick (i‚Äôd be in tears begging her to help and make it stop) 

so i lost a lot of weight and i was so hungry or malnourished? that i would stand up and couldn‚Äôt move because id be in extreme pain in my stomach. that kinda fixed itself or got better my phobia, but time went on the over covid i gained weight and i started to really be insecure about my body. i also did high intensity sport everyday, then my coach put me on a meal plan i won‚Äôt go into detail about it. that really messed me up especially when he told me my BMI. fast forward i would do all normal or thought to be normal anorexic things (counting cals, not eating etc) and saw some results. also started self harm so not fun

anyways i was better last year. if anything i went the opposite i couldn‚Äôt stop eating, but this year (also i went full time vegan end of 2021) i had 3 deaths in a short period of time and i started liking the control i got from it. i wasn‚Äôt doing it for how i looked i‚Äôm doing it for how it makes me feel, and how i don‚Äôt feel the grief. i also am very much a perfectionist, but i feel so bad saying i have an ed, yet i also sort of crave the validation to know i‚Äôm not just an attention seeker? i don‚Äôt think people have noticed because i do eat and i can eat a lot sometimes, i also have not lost a significant amount of weight. i want the validation to say yes you do struggle with this and your not being dramatic, but then i don‚Äôt want to change because i like the control?

i‚Äôm looking for advice or views. i‚Äôm not trying to trauma dump or whatever, i just want peoples opinions on this as i feel so invalid for saying i have an ed. i want someone to notice but then i don‚Äôt want help? it sounds so bad",16gh5ur,3,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16gh5ur/can_i_still_say_i_have_anorexia_even_if_i_dont/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-12 04:04:12

Doctor isn‚Äôt worried about me - feeling invalidated,"I saw a doctor for the first time since I lost a lot of weight. It wasn‚Äôt ED related, my lower back has been hurting for a few weeks and I wanted to make sure it wasn‚Äôt something kidney related or if I could maybe get a stronger painkiller. 

But without saying numbers, I have gone from just at the cusp of normal and underweight BMI (which I had been maintaining for like ten years) to several BMI points lower since I last saw a doctor in May. I was expecting the doctor to bring that up but she didn‚Äôt. I was mostly hoping she wouldn‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt want recover and I can‚Äôt talk about it without crying, but now that she didn‚Äôt say a word I feel like I have to get sicker :/ Like I‚Äôm barely eating anything and I‚Äôm suffering so much and it‚Äôs not enough for a doctor to be worried?? To be fair, she barely talked to me at all and told me to just wait for it to heal on its own. So maybe she wasn‚Äôt the most attentive doctor. 

I do have a nutritionist and a therapist who are worried about me and were asking me to see a doctor. But I‚Äôve been hesitant because 1. I don‚Äôt intend to cooperate and get better and 2. I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm physically sick enough for anyone to take me seriously. And now I know. 

Side note, has anyone else ever experienced lower back pain because of anorexia? Idk how those would be related, especially since I still have my period so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs brittle bones or anything.

I‚Äôm desperate for advice/support‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm not sick enough to get inpatient treatment, according to the BMI and the numbers on the scales. I‚Äôm not honest with my therapists about how badly I‚Äôm doing, because they all look at my ‚Äúnormal weight‚Äù and concludes that I‚Äôm doing good. They believe I‚Äôm in recovery/am recovered. Which is so far from the truth. I know for a fact that if I was to be honest with them, about my severely restrictive eating, they would kick me out of their outpatient clinic and I would be transferred to an outpatient clinic for people with EDS. Which probably wouldn‚Äôt be too bad. Especially if one takes into consideration that my therapists aren‚Äôt specialized in EDS at all. But I don‚Äôt see how different therapists should be able to help me outpatient, even if they are specialized in EDS. They would also just let the numbers on the scales dictate wether or not I need outpatient or inpatient treatment. And they would then most likely decided that it‚Äôs perfectly fine for me to continue with outpatient therapy. But I don‚Äôt agree with that at all. I don‚Äôt want to gain weight, because I‚Äôm most likely still at a normal weight (it‚Äôs been quite some time since I last got weighed at the outpatient clinic). However, my eating is completely and extremely out of my control. I don‚Äôt have any set meals, and for the first time ever, (possible TW) I‚Äôve gone a day or two without eating. I‚Äôm very depressed and can‚Äôt cope. I want to eat, yet at the same time I‚Äôm terrified of food and eating. I‚Äôm seeing a counselor who struggled a lot with EDS AN herself, and who considers herself recovered. She told me how she is seriously worried for me and my health, and that inpatient treatment is the best and only option of treatment if I want to get better. She knows I can‚Äôt do this on my own. I can‚Äôt eat on my own. She wants me to be honest with my current therapists. But it‚Äôs just so hard. Last time I were honest in regards to my eating habits, they got really mad and upset with me. They told me that eating enough calories during the day is very easy, and how there‚Äôs no excuse for not doing exactly as I‚Äôm being told (eating the amount of food they want me to eat).

Mom asking how to help,"Hii, I‚Äôm undiagnosed but i am talking to a therapist .

 I am not underweight, i am not ready to recover at all because i think calling it an ed is invalid. People have it worse, I don‚Äôt look like that so I‚Äôm fine, i still eat every single day, blablabla. But i do notice how my behaviors are getting slightly worse.

 My mom is constantly asking me how she can help. She cries every time and tells me that she can‚Äôt take it anymore to see me like this. I compensate (hope that this is a safe way to say this) and my therapist told my mom that she should stop me when i want to compensate. I told them I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that at all even tho my mom wants to help and means it all well. 

Now she asks me if i compensate and that makes me very very uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt want to lie but i don‚Äôt want to hurt her either. I want to recover for her not for myself. Yet.  How can she help? What can she do? When she asks that question I don‚Äôt know how to answer it bc I don‚Äôt even want any help/don‚Äôt know how to help myself either.

I'm not sure if I'm bulimic or teetering towards anorexia since self-diagnosis is awkward to me, but I body check every so often almost daily, suppress my urges to eat, feeling sickly after eating, no appetite some days, binge and purge from time to time.

Worried I'm developing unhealthy habits,"Recently I've been trying to get back in shape, which for me means gaining muscle however I keep getting caught up in that basic rule of burning more calories than I take in. I started running again but quickly realised that id need to adjust my diet to see a significant difference.

I started by just eating healthier foods but I can only make what's accessable to me and of course there were days where there were only less healthy foods left. If my meals were going to be more calorie packed I should just eat less right? But it kept escalating, I started bringing a lunch to school which I'd never consistently done before, but I always felt guilty about whatever I ate and it would end up being the only thing I ate that day. 

I wouldn't have much energy but I'd always go for my runs at the end of the day, there were a few times I collapsed from pure hunger but when I got home and saw the food in my kitchen I felt disgusted at the thought of being so weak and giving in to the temptation, so wouldn't let myself

Then something changed, All of a sudden mid fall temperatures are up to 30¬∞C after 2 straight months of rain. So throughout the days, I wore lighter clothes, clothes that showed more of my body. Everyday I would get back from my run and look at myself in the full length mirror that covers an entire wall in my bedroom and everyday I would focus in on one part, my ribs.

For the first time in my life I could see my ribs and it made me happy, but the next day I would eat and they would dispear again, so I stopped eating. It stoped being about the little bit of fat on my thighs turning to muscle and it became about how much of my ribcage I could see.  

My dilemma. I work a physical job on the weekends and I can't be weak and lethargic, I need energy, but I love seeing more and more of my ribcage in the mirror and I don't want to give that up. I wanna see how far I can take this but I don't know if it's sustainable.

I feel so ashamed of my body,"TW

I lost so much weight in the last few months and I look like a completely different person. I never had a big chest or butt, but at least I had a little. Enough, I‚Äòd say. Now I don‚Äôt. I am completely flat. Like, absolutely flat. I have nothing left. And when I say nothing, I mean it. I‚Äòd almost say it looks ‚Äùfunny‚Äú. Not to me, but to others. I notice people staring, some are chuckling. I don‚Äôt know for sure if it‚Äôs because of me or if they are laughing about something else, but I have this weird feeling it‚Äôs about me. The stares are directed at me though. I feel so child-like and the irony with this is that this feeling was always my goal while suffering from anorexia. Now that I basically have the body of a child, besides the fact that I am very, very tall, I feel so ugly. My butt is as flat as a wall (not kidding), and I have zero boobs left. Oh my god, I cannot even begin to describe how ashamed I feel. Everywhere I see these beautiful women with their curves and healthy face and body and I can‚Äôt help but feel disgusting. I know my boyfriend loves me the way I am, he always reminds me of that, but I am so scared he doesn‚Äôt feel attracted to me anymore. He told me he still is, and that that‚Äòll never change, but he‚Äôs worried nonetheless. Does anyone feel the same way? Now that I have my ‚Äùdream body‚Äú, I am more unsatisfied with it than ever before. I am not a woman anymore. Not saying women with my body type aren‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just not. Not anymore. And it‚Äôs hard not to cry every time I‚Äôm out and see all these stunning women while I‚Äôm sitting here feeling disgusted with the body I always wanted to have. I didn‚Äôt just lose weight, I lost everything. My smile, my personality, my happiness and ultimately myself. For what? I still feel fat, even though I deep down know how I look. Sometimes I see it and I don‚Äôt recognize myself anymore. Everyone‚Äôs shocked when they look at me, strangers literally talk to me on the street about my body (don‚Äôt know where they got the audacity from), stare and shake their head and yesterday, a homeless shouted after me that ‚ÄùOh wow!‚Äú I ‚Äùlook as emaciated as him‚Äú. I bawled my eyes out in my car after that. A few years ago I would‚Äòve felt weirdly proud, now I‚Äôm just so ashamed. I‚Äôm convinced that especially men are making fun of my body.

There's no way out of this. Even if I recover, the ugly thoughts about food and my body will still remain somewhere in my mind. I can never eat chips while actually enjoying it.

I literally do not know why I feel better when I do and I‚Äôm weirded out by the fact I feel good about myself when I starve. I‚Äôve really been trying but recovery is so hard. At first I‚Äôm hopeful and optimistic but then when the weight starts gaining I feel horrible. Weight only goes to my stomach and no where else and I do not have a fast metabolism at all. I have a bad habit of body checking every moment of the day, I‚Äôve been able to stop checking the scale, I used to 6-7 times a day alone, but trying to stop body check is hard. And then people‚Äôs comment online hurt a lot too. I‚Äôve seen stuff like ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt cry when I eat‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôve gone stupid from starving‚Äù as insults and it hurts a lot even though the comment was directed to some anorexic person being rude and mean. I don‚Äôt agree with what that anorexic person said at all, but the comment they received hurts me so bad. Those comments kept replaying in my head over and over all today and my eyes hurt from crying. It‚Äôs hard to ignore comments like that and I can‚Äôt even if I tried. I once saw a a bunch of people in a comment section making fun of an anorexic person and going off about how she‚Äôs so dumb and lost braincells from starving. Today i under ate a lot, it‚Äôs no where enough for a person my age and height to eat. I feel guilty for starving but at the same time I‚Äôm feeling guilty for eating. I really hate that I put myself through this",16cxt4s,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16cxt4s/failing_recovery_for_the_second_time/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-08 02:09:35

i dont feel sick enough,"i apologise for the essay im about to write. but basically, i was in hospital for 3 months for reasons other than my ed, while also being treated for it. it started off with me going into general hospital because of my anorexia but ended up being admitted to a psychiatric hospital for different reasons. while i was in hospital, nobody cared. my ed brain was happy they didnt at the time, but now i look at it and i feel so invalid. they would let me walk around and go to the toilet after meals, even though i would purge everytime i did so. and the worst part is they knew i was doing it and they didnt do anything about it. 
in another unit i was in, there were other patients who had anorexia. i dont want to sound like a narcissistic asshole when i say this, but i wish the staff cared about me and my ed nearly as much as they cared about theirs. they gave 0 fucks about my eating disorder and i feel like if they cared, even just a tiny bit, i wouldnt have left there feeling like no one gives a shit and i can just go back to my eating habits without anyone batting an eye. i understand that they were more severe cases, i really do, and i was ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù so they didnt have to do anything, but cmon. they would do weigh ins and notice i was losing weight and did nothing. im not trying to blame anyone for my relapse but i just feel so alone. my mum enables me, and just when things are starting to get worse again im discharged from all services. im constantly in a war with my head, and no one seems to care.

I already checked all my syllabuses and this isnt mentioned anywhere. How should i word these emails? i also dont want to ask them in person but again, i will if i have to. does anyone have experience with this or any tips? this is my first uni semester in recovery and i dont want to mess things up for myself.

Scared of getting help,"Hello everyone, my name is Daniel and I'm 21 years old.
I struggled with anorexia for two years, from 2018 - 2020.
After I met my current boyfriend I started recovering (all on my own, never seeked professional help). 
So from 2021 my boyfriend and me went to the gym, started weightlifting and I started to gain a significant amount of weight/muscles.
But I also started with tracking my cal intake, so I make sure I gain weight/muscles. 
Fast forward, this year in April, I started my diet to lose some body fat and that's where it all started again.
I got really obsessed with making sure I walk enough steps a day, never overeat my cal, so I started with the same old behaviors as my old anorexic self. 
Now in September, I lost a significant amount of weight, I'm nearly at the weight again where I first meet my boyfriend.

He also noticed that I lost some weight.
I keep telling myself that If lose just some more kilograms  than I will stop and start maintaining.

I at the lowest of the normal weight (bmi wise).
So I don't really think Im sick enough to deserve some help.
But my relationship with food is so fcked up. 
I don't know what to do, I just feel depressed since months and I don't know where I should start to get help..... what if the doctors don't see any problem???

confused,"Why are so many eating disorder treatment centers HAES aligned?

why is the ideal weight based on growth charts? i read the explanation on the feast-ed.org site and it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me? ‚ÄúMany clinics now use lifetime height and weight charts to determine where a patient would have been had the illness not altered growth‚Ä¶ It is possible for a person to have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or high BMI but still be significantly underweight for his or her own frame and physiology.‚Äù how does this logic only apply to people with normal/overweight BMI and not an underweight one? what if you had poor eating habits ie one that was mainly made up of junk food instead of whole food? it kinda just seems like the set point theory to me WHICH IS A THEORY. for me personally i weighed the most i ever did in middle school bc of my poor eating habits like i would mainly just eat chips, cookies, etc. how is that healthy? i started to lose weight as i started to incorporate more whole foods into my diet over the years (not intentionally trying to lose weight although it wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue since i was nearly overweight anyway). in college, i developed an ED and became extremely underweight which was years after i had unintentionally lost the previous weight. **I do think it‚Äôs important to mention that i‚Äôve gained some weight and i‚Äôm back to the healthy bmi range. ** now i‚Äôm being told i need to weigh as much as i did in middle school and that it‚Äôs the ideal weight to me, which has me extremely confused? i understand wanting me to be within the healthy BMI range but why is there so much fixation on setting my ideal weight based on ‚Äúgrowth charts‚Äù which are literally just dependent on the person‚Äôs eating habits anyway. it doesn‚Äôt take into account how the person was eating prior to the ED.

Imposter syndrome,"I‚Äôve always felt like my struggles were never bad enough to label as an eating disorder or to deserve help. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about my weight, but I will say I‚Äôve never been hospitalized and I don‚Äôt think my health has been in serious danger. 

Still, my disordered eating has impacted my life so heavily, for as long as I‚Äôve been conscious. I‚Äôve never had a healthy relationship with my body and food, for so many reasons mostly trauma related. 

The best way I can describe this feeling is imposter syndrome. When I consider the idea of people knowing I have an eating disorder, it makes me cringe and want to disappear. It feels like I don‚Äôt deserve it, if that at all makes sense. I don‚Äôt deserve help, I don‚Äôt deserve concern, and I certainly don‚Äôt deserve to claim the title of eating disorder without a diagnosis and while others are struggling so much more severely. 

My ED is manageable in the sense that I can live, but my compulsions around food have made it so that I can‚Äôt eat without being completely comfortable. I can‚Äôt eat much around friends, I can‚Äôt do anything food related without my anxiety medication if I haven‚Äôt done my rituals.  

I need help. And I can‚Äôt ask for it, because even saying the word makes me feel so vulnerable and afraid. 

But I‚Äôm admitting it here. I need help, I don‚Äôt know where to start.",16b20dr,7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16b20dr/imposter_syndrome/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-05 22:12:21

Anyone out here over 30 ?,"I‚Äôm almost 29 and I‚Äôve been battling with this illness for 10 years now! On and off recovery, it feels like I‚Äôm never gonna live a normal life. This shit is so hard.

Also NEVER limiting foods, if she wants chocolate before breakfast she will get it while I get her breakfast ready. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else is like me, late twenties, thirties. How does it feel for you ? How is your schedule with kids if you own any.

I‚Äôm trying so hard to eat healthy and recover every time again because I want to be there for her. I want to set a good example but most importantly I need to be ALIVE.

How to Get Help for Your Parent with Anorexia,"Note: I apologize in advance for the novel. I‚Äôm also planning to cross-post this on a couple of other threads. 

I am a mid-thirties adult. My mom is 71. She has always been very thin and self-critical about her weight. I and my siblings heard comments all the time growing up (often critical of herself, terribly critical of heavy-set strangers, even critical of close friends who put on a few pounds, though never to their faces). Even though she never ate much, she seemed to be maintaining enough weight that she was not actually physically unhealthy. 

However, she just visited my family for a week. She is exceedingly thin. Thinner than I have ever seen her. She also made frequent comments about food. ‚ÄúOh, I am not hungry.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is so much food!‚Äù ‚ÄúI really shouldn‚Äôt eat this.‚Äù ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt we just eat breakfast?‚Äù ‚ÄúI always eat so much when I visit you.‚Äù And on and on. She ate alarmingly little. I myself am on the light side of normal weight-wise. I was not forcefeeding her donuts. We eat well-rounded, balanced meals. 

I am not sure how to get her help. She has a primary care physician who she sees for a check up once a year, various specialists she sees occasionally, and a psychiatrist she sees every couple of months. She has bipolar disorder and it is well controlled. She also has anxiety and it is medicated but seems less well controlled. She lives alone. 

Do I try to speak to her psychiatrist first or her general practitioner? Can they even speak to me legally? I didn‚Äôt bring it up with her during this visit because I didn‚Äôt want to be shut out‚Äîshe is more than capable of just closing off that topic of conversation and self-censoring so that I can‚Äôt tell where her mind is on food and eating. 

I am very worried about her. Any advice is helpful. Thank you in advance.",16au9qn,14,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16au9qn/how_to_get_help_for_your_parent_with_anorexia/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-05 17:23:06

I'm so triggered,I've been having some non ed related health issues and it's so insanely triggering. I have a low thyroid and im so stressed it's going to make me fat or gain weight. So many of the symptoms of a low thyroid are similar to malnutrition and I'm getting stressed because i can't tell which is which. I've been physically recovered for a while but i still have some lingering issues and I'm still really messed up mentally. I want to know im still having malnutrition symptoms to feels valid but i can't tell. Im on the verge of relapsing. I've looked up some of my issues online and it says common causes are obesity and an unhealthy diet which is killing me. Logically i know I'm not overweight and it's not my fault but i feel so bad and conflicted. I've unintentionally lost a little weight and it's making me want to make it a little more.,168q3p1,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/168q3p1/im_so_triggered/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-03 07:01:56
Stumbled into another relapse‚Ä¶,"The last four years I have been in and out of treatment centers for my anorexia. 2019 I rushed through the process because I had to go back to work and also found out while I was in treatment that the friend I was living with was wanting me to move out. So when I transferred my care to my city, I had to deal with treatment 12 hours a day, then find time to completely move my stuff out and into a storage unit because I had nowhere else to go yet. Then I had to go back to work in august and juggle treatment three days a week for three hours after I went to work. The person I ended up staying with didn‚Äôt work out for me so I had to find yet another place to live and I was only there for a month or two before I found a room I could rent. I was so stressed out and kind of ambivalent about recovery because my way of coping worked so much better for me. Of course by the time January 2020 came around I was sicker than before and forced by my employer to go back into treatment. That time I tried harder though it was a rocky start. I finished the middle of July and started a new job and then had to find yet a new place to live. But I was okay for a while. 2022 I relapsed again quite severely. Ended up back in treatment and was doing okay even though things were stressful at work. Then I was laid off from my job in February this year. Stressor #1. Tried to find a job not having any luck until I went back to the company I was laid off from to ask for an entry level position knowing I would be taking a pay cut. Then major stressor #2. My background check came back with charges on it from 2020 that I had no idea existed. Long story short- I took an OD of my own medication and went to the er and then to a psych hospital in the beginning of my treatment of 2020. Fought to get back in treatment and worked my ass off to get better. Upon finding out that I had warrants out for my arrest, I consulted with multiple people who advised me to go and turn myself in. So I did that. I had to pay for a bailbond since I don‚Äôt have that kind of money. And I now have attorney fees to cover in hopes that he‚Äôll be able to help me get the charges lessened or dismissed‚Ä¶ as I clearly wasn‚Äôt in a good mental state when the offense occurred. Stressor #3 I have no control over the situation and basically in limbo. My court date is still a couple weeks away and I am uncertain of how it will go. I am in limbo with the job because though I took care of the warrants they want to wait for the outcome of the court date before taking any further steps. And I still can‚Äôt find any other jobs. I‚Äôve been getting more and more depressed and my psychiatric treatment has been lacking as I don‚Äôt have the resources to go consistently right now. I‚Äôve been rationing my medications. And I began restricting more since I found all this out. The last 6 weeks I have decompensated drastically and I feel the physical/physiological effects of it on my body. But I can‚Äôt pull myself out. I‚Äôm afraid I am on my way into another relapse that I might not make it out of.",168omzf,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/168omzf/stumbled_into_another_relapse/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-09-03 05:36:39

Does it ever get easier?,"I (23F) have been trying to recover from AN-R for a little less than a month. It‚Äôs been really, really hard. Some days are better than others, but today was just the worst. I woke up wanting to restrict and made it halfway through the day before I wanted a snack ‚Äî after that, my hunger cues were all over the place. That was bad enough. But when I got on the phone later to chat with my partner, they were talking excitedly about food and recipes and because they don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve been struggling, I just listened along and felt nauseous in silence.

Finally, this evening, I went a little crazy with dessert. The sugar crash completely depleted me and now I‚Äôm laying on my bed feeling worse than ever.

I know recovery is hard. I also know it‚Äôs not linear. But since I started, my mental health has been at its absolute lowest. I‚Äôm doing absolutely everything I can to compensate: I have hobbies, I spend time with friends, I try to find recipes I‚Äôm excited about, I get sun and plenty of water. But nothing is helping. I am utterly consumed with thoughts of my next meal. I have nightmares about calories and gaining weight. I suffer constant ugly, mean intrusive thoughts about myself and everyone I see.

I‚Äôm really really really trying to have a positive outlook. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I hate food and I‚Äôm so tired of eating.

A small story from being sent to the hospital,"Like a year ago, I had perhaps one of the funniest things ever happen when it comes to healthcare and such. 

To give some context, at the time I was morbidly obese, however I was already deep as fuck in anorexia, I had a very bad period during which I didn't eat for way way too long, I was passing out almost everyday at least once, had my pulse dip below safe levels, and overall I have never been that sick before or since.

Went to my doctor, he went ""Holy shit"" sent me to the hospital, I agreed, didn't fancy dying.

I get there, tell them I have an ED, due to my size they assume I'm bulimic or have BED or something, had to explicitly tell them I'm anorexic, doctor kinda didn't believe it, asked how much I weigh, I chucked and answered ""too much""... Then I proceed to tell them basically everything in detail. 

I was there for hours and hours, they ran a lot of tests, took a lot of blood, I had severel talks with doctors about different crap...

Anyhow, like 5 or something hours after I got there, this doctor that looks like the chad meme comes in and says something like...

""Most of your results are fine, you have midly low potassium but nothing too alarming, I see no reason for you to stay here, we can't really treat your ED, that's more a thing for the psych clinic, but I can ask of the psych hospital will take you in instead""

I wait another hour...

""Well, the psych hospital sees no reason to take you in unless you're suicidal or severely depressed, to clarify, you're not, right?""

I said ""I'm anorexic ofc I'm fucking depressed... but no I don't want to kill myself""

Then he went ""well in that case I think it's best if you go home, I can write some notes in your files for the psych clinic and... blah blah""

I looked at him like ""wait, for real?""

I guess I'm just gonna have to come back when I'm dying then I guess lmao

Nah seriously its been a year and I still genuinely can't believe they let me go, like at the time I was so sure that I'm gonna stay that I didn't even plan for a way to get home, it was nighttime and my mum had to come fetch me in pitch darkness 

I kinda laugh when I think back at this

I‚Äôm at a normal bmi but I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight- to a point where I had to get my gallbladder removed a few weeks ago 

But so I open up to my therapist and she‚Äôs like well a hospital wouldn‚Äôt admit u at this weight (confirming in my mind that I am not sick enough :/ ) and she told me things such as u can count cals u just need to eat a higher number and was labeling some foods as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (she was saying I just need to eat healthy foods and not fast food) also I ‚Äúbinge‚Äù (meaning I‚Äôll eat a fast food meal that a normal person would eat and not feel bad abt) and I was like it‚Äôs not really a binge like a normal person would eat this and be ok and she was like well one quesadilla from Taco Bell is not normal or healthy ????????

She also said I wouldn‚Äôt gain weight if I just ate clean but at a higher number (I mean I know that‚Äôs not true it‚Äôs kinda inevitable) 

Basically it triggered me a lot‚Äî she‚Äôs not a Ed specialist and she has a history of an Ed herself so like I feel very stupid and like I‚Äôm not sick enough and it just sucks a lot

Vent/recovery-like info.,"So life's been crazy this summer. But since some things have begun to change for the better, I was happier, but than last night as me and my family were out getting stuff, I saw myself several times in the Target mirrors. Of course the thoughts came ""you look like you're pregnant"", ""wow you're fat"".

If you've seen my posts, I'm anorexic (I know I don't look it, but diagnosed). But I refed last year and went to a place even to try to get help for this. I majorly overshoot my original weight (without knowing or being told until January, not to mention how many times my family and I got sick in the winter and spring time from flu to covid to just sickness which messed with my recovery). So I'm twice the amount that I lost in the first place (rare I'm guessing because I don't hear about many that happens to). I'm trying to remind myself that if I do what people want (a drastic crash MLM, what got me into this mess, well it's further back but more like this onset of things) I'll end up back where I was before or even worse.

It's hard because I think ""I feel comfortable in these clothes"" then I look at myself in that mirror and think of how it makes me look horrible. Add to this, I just got on some birth control pills (for the first time in my life, and I'm old lol) to help with my pmdd (major mood issues). So it makes me want to eat, like before I could ignore but like now I'll try to eat even if it's not a meal. My doctor is happy with how my weight is, I'm not.

I didn't realise how much anorexia drained me,"Today is the first day of school. In fact, I'm writing this as I'm sitting in my desk. I never understood anorexic people who always said they were tired all the time... Until now. I used to lay in bed the whole day so I pretty much didn't even use any of my energy. But now, just sitting for 6 hours makes me want to kms. Not only is it draining physicaly, but mentally too.

"So, I relapsed‚Ä¶","I admit it. I‚Äôve relapsed and I‚Äôve been consciously choosing day after day for almost 2 weeks now to restrict. I am fully aware of everything because I was in inpatient and outpatient treatment for a year and a half (all together) and I‚Äôve learned everything about eating disorders and patterns and why symptoms occur etc etc but I don‚Äôt want to use any of the knowledge I have. 

I am fully aware I am starving myself horribly especially now that I checked my average calorie intake yesterday and realized how low I‚Äôve actually gone (I wasn‚Äôt counting during these 2 weeks, just restricting). But I don‚Äôt want to stop.

I had 4 pets who were my closest family (I‚Äôm NC with my whole family except mom), and 2 weeks ago the last one passed. I am still in therapy because of other disorders I have and I have an appointment on Monday, but I feel that if my therapist (she‚Äôs not specialized in eating disorders) tries to get me to go back to healthy eating habits, I will push her away‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs been the best therapist I‚Äôve ever had and she is very understanding so I hope she won‚Äôt push anything on me. 

I‚Äôve made close friends in the treatment program who are thankfully recovered so I don‚Äôt want to tell them as not to trigger them, so I‚Äôm confessing here‚Ä¶ I know one day I‚Äôll get back to being healthy, but right now, I don‚Äôt want to.

I kinda need advice,"So I've struggled with food from about like 13. When I was 13 I ate waaayyy too much and gained a lot of weight extremely quickly(beginning of High school I weighed about 150kg) and was bullied terribly for it. I then decided to stop eating and it worked really well for a while. I lost a lot of weight and started to feel better, the bullying didn't stop but I at least made some friends in other grades. My self esteem never recovered. But I did as I went to a psych clinic and went on a eating programe 
I'm now 21 and I've started to gain a little more weight(not necessarily a bad thing, I now weigh 70kg) but I realized I'm starting to think shifty thoughts about myself and I have the urge to not eat at all anymore.

Advice needed,"I need advice

Background information: I was diagnosed w an eating disorder (anorexia). I have been in hospital recovery for 3 months, been discharged, and relapsed terribly. Recently with family I have been in all-in recovery.( Please search it up if you dk what it is) I have been in all in recovery for about 3months now. During the first couple weeks of it, I gained some weight and my family has acted proud. Now, I've suddenly been either losing or not gaining (I haven't weighed for my mental state) and everyone is invalidating me. I have been in my extreme hunger phase and experiencing a shit ton of mental hunger. I always honor it and I eat whatever I crave and want now. Most of the time I feel like I'm binging. I could eat 10 or more pieces of chocolate at once and multiple packs of sweets like brownies and cookies. However tho for some reason, since I'm not gaining a lot of weight anymore and still ""skinny"", my family has been screaming at me and saying I'm still ""anorexic"" and I still don't honor my cravings and eat whatever I want whenever I want, WHEN IN REALITY, IM DOING EXACTLY THAT AND SO MUCH MORE. Everyday after meals I feel like I've binged but I ignore it. I'm eating enormous amounts of chocolates, cookies, and other sweets etc. But everyone is just attacking me now and I feel like giving up.

I want to relapse,"When I started medically transitioning I went on a weight loss journey as I was obese and wanted to look beautiful, I was successful in this so successful in fact that my doctor told me to stop losing weight as she said it would be harmful if I continued.

I knew what anorexia led to so I stopped my weight loss and started maintaining the weight I had then.

My hrt then stopped working due to an endocrine issue and I started binge eating again to cope with how bad testosterone puberty made me feel.

The endocrine issue has been solved but the damage has been done and I really want to relapse so I can get close to my goal weight and then stop when I reach it.

I feel too healthy to get help (TW),"Some days I realize how sick I look and the other day I feel like I look normal, if not chubby. Doctor was worried about my health when he saw me but only until my bloodwork returned normal. According to that, everything is fine. I still get my period every month (different from my ‚Äùnormal‚Äú period though but I still get it) even though I am pretty fucking underweight. I heard it‚Äôs related to body fat, but my doctor literally told me I‚Äôm losing muscle mass and that it‚Äôs starting to affect the metabolism in my brain so that can‚Äôt be the reason. My hair still looks full and shiny (besides a few strands that are breaking off but they‚Äôre dyed, so no wonder) and my skin is clean. I often have heart palpitations but my doctor tested my heart and it‚Äôs working perfectly. I don‚Äôt fucking get it. One day, my tooth starts to break off, I literally struggle to walk, have the worst stomach and head aches, shaking like crazy and feeling like I‚Äôm dying and the other day I feel like everything is alright because according to my bloodwork everything is fine. When my weight was much higher, only moderately underweight, I had many deficiencies yet now, severely underweight, everything is fine?!  I‚Äôm thinking of going inpatient again but I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm too healthy for that. On other days, I basically want to call an ambulance because I feel like my body is giving up. What is this? People keep telling me that I look sicker and worse every day but everything seems to work just fine in my body. My anxiety is CRAZY. But why is everything normal? Is there any explainable reason for why this is happening? I mean, I am glad that I am not on the verge of death, obviously, but I am also convinced that I am too healthy to get help.

Can‚Äôt remember why I started recovery. Help,"I was in denial about my ED for a long time. I thought someone like me couldn‚Äôt have ana and even after eating just a piece of lettuce with mustard on it one day I thought it was normal. Family and friends went from praising me to being worried but I never saw it. I went from a few lbs overweight to underweight as an adult man and all I was focused on was losing the next 5. I used to fast for days at a time, too exhausted to do that anymore so I shifted to consistent calories but extreme restriction (less than half TDEE) and at least 2 hours running. I obsessively counted, weighed, prepped and planned meals up to 3 days in advance and scheduled them out to the minute. It sucked every drop of joy out of my life, a couple weeks ago I woke up at 5 am and walked 5 hours until 10 am to justify eating breakfast with my sister and then I just ate an apple and 2 slices of keto toast. Anyway, 2 weekends ago, I ran a self punishing half marathon after bingeing like 4 peanut butter sandwiches and then my heart gave out and I went to the hospital. I was very underweight. I was diagnosed ana 3 or 4 months ago but never cared. This was the wake up call, I thought. So I started recovery, all these awful symptoms like constant crushing fatigue, chest pain, trouble sleeping, night sweats, and joint/muscle pain so bad I‚Äôve been walking on crutches. My legs don‚Äôt work. So I‚Äôve stopped running for the first time in ages on top of deleting my calorie counting apps and then of course comes the insatiable hunger. I have not stopped eating the last 10 days, I am so fucking ravenously starving, I am eating more than double TDEE this last week. My whole body is swollen (edema). Today I weighed myself and somehow I gained so many fucking pounds in a week and a half. I can feel the fat in my face, in my stomach, I feel like an obese fat failure and I keep looking at photos of myself at my lw. How did this happen in 10 fucking days. My nightmare literally coming true. All I want is to count calories again, suddenly it feels like the planning and strategizing and counting was fun, I miss the excitement of the scale going down, I feel like I lost a part of myself but I don‚Äôt want to go back to the hospital.

Call for Feedback - ED App Idea,"Dear Community,

hi! I'm a current psych undergrad working on a project I would love to hear your thoughts on. Please spread the word because Feedback from people affected by eating disorders, especially severe ones, is very valuable in this case.

While working together with people affected by eating disorders for my internship and organising workshops on the topic, I found a common factor that contributes to ED-behaviors, especially in adolescents: calorie counting apps. I was thinking about how this problem could be solved, because usually recommending them to delete the app just leads to them hiding it.

Seeing as bodily hunger and satiety signals aren't very present in people with chronic/persistent EDs, eating within a healthy calorie range also becomes harder.

This lead me to a thought that maybe tracking the things eaten isn't the problem, but it's the numbers. Hm. Maybe an app that tracks calories without showing numbers, just giving a soft colour-coded signal if the user is eating over or under their recommended daily average to get to a healthy BMI which also tracks if the user experienced hunger or satiety signals and offers mindfulness exercises for thoughts of binging/restricting calories.

Target Audience: People with severe/chronic EDs who are severely over/underweight.

Main goal: offer support and promote a healthier relationship with food for those dealing with eating disorders, whether it's overcoming overeating or undereating.  
App Concept:  
The app aims to help users better understand their bodily signals of hunger and satiety. It discreetly tracks calorie intake using color-coding (no numbers), gently guiding users towards their daily caloric goals. The app also includes a mindfulness feature to help cope with binge urges, providing a holistic approach to managing eating habits and emotions.

Your Feedback Matters:  
I would love to hear from you about your thoughts on this app concept. Your insights are incredibly valuable as we work to refine and improve the app. If you or someone you know has experience with eating disorders, your inquiries and feedback would be immensely appreciated. Here are some questions to get the conversation started:

1. Does the app's concept resonate with you? Is it something you believe could offer meaningful support?
2. What features stand out to you the most? Is there anything you would like to see added or adjusted?
3. How do you feel about the color-coded calorie tracking approach? Does it seem like a helpful and sensitive way to approach this aspect?
4. The mindfulness feature is designed to help with coping strategies. What are your thoughts on its potential effectiveness?
5. Any suggestions for app names or additional features that could enhance the overall experience?

Please feel free to share your thoughts, concerns, and questions in the comments. Your input will play a significant role in shaping this project. Let's work together to create a tool that can truly make a positive impact!

Thank you so much in advance!",165h5zy,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/165h5zy/call_for_feedback_ed_app_idea/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-30 15:02:51

"A part from a book called ""The Time In Between"" by Nancy Tucker that I wanted to share. It's her hate letter for anorexia. Thought it was beautiful in a weird way.","""Dear Anorexia,

I sometimes wonder why you chose me. I suppose I just looked like an easy target - and I was. Small and soft and defenceless. I suppose you just thought, ""Bingo"". I'd seen you go for others, and certainly heard about the things you could do, but I, being big-headed and simple-minded, thought I would be able to stand up to you. On the surface I was sympathetic to your victims, but inside I scoffed at their ""weakness"". 

When you first started picking on me it wasn't too bad. The chipping away was so gradual it was almost imperceptible. I knew some of the things you were making me do were painful, but I went along with them anyway - I was sure that, in the long run, I would be able to stay on top enough to ensure that I reaped the benefits of the relationship but side-stepped the costs. How naive I was. 

I suppose I should have started getting worried when I realised that you weren't planning on stopping your manipulations any time soon. What I thought was the extent of your torture turned out to be the merest appetiser. You started to twist me, playing sick games with my head. You made me work so hard for rewards you promised to give - except, of course, when the work was done you never coughed up. You never stopped moving the goalposts. 

The worst part was the way you could be the sweetest thing in the world. Kind, caring - you could make me love you so much it hurt. That was always the moment - the moment when you were holding me tight, lifting me high into the air - that you would drop me. And I could never tell which I was going to face - the friend or the foe. You were completely in control; I was a puppet. If you could feel my skeleton then the world was my oyster. If there was too much disgusting, disfiguring flesh masking it, the consequences were dire. Just as you could make me feel like the best of the best, you could instantly turn me into the lowest, most despicable creature on earth. You made me feel like tarnished silver- never bright enough, no matter how hard I polished. 

People began to notice how you were treating me, but they just didn't know how to help. Because some huge, deranged part of me knew the torture you were putting me through but could not - and cannot - stand up to you. You've taken so much from me, and that includes my ability to think logically; to do the right thing. I know that you are spiteful and malicious; that you will never give me all that you promise; that you lie and sneer and take and take and take. You jeer at me constantly, pointedly lavishing your attention on your special, beautiful, other friends. You never seem to be angry with them, it's always me. I suppose I must be the only one who gets so many things wrong. 

You'd think, being able to see all these things, I would be able to shun you once and for all. You make me cold and weak and tired and mean. You make me black out when I stand up and ache all over when I go to bed. When I eat, you make my stomach swell and my skin stretch, and you scream and scream and scream at me until death seems attractive - at least it would be quiet. That's what you make me want - to be so skeletally thin that the only thing left to do is die. 

You're a monster, Anorexia. Skeletal but strong; enticing but evil; comforting but cruel. And yet - despite the taunts and the tricks and the torment - I still feel drawn to you like a helpless magnet. I still don't want you to leave me.

noticing things,"I've started to notice how comfortable and normal people are with eating and food and eating habits. and how I've started noticing things like too many things about non disordered people and I've even occasionally started condescending them kinda. its like my brain is messed up lretty much. because I feel ohh they could be skinnier and look better too! like bruh. what the fuck. I can't just these thoughts they come to me. 

why am I viewing good people this way. I'm afraid I might portray or say it directly or indirectly one day just automatically. 

I've been realising slowly how good and healthy other people's eating habits and relationship with food is.
mine is just really bad. no matter how hard I try I CANNOT look at food and my body a certain, good way. it always has to be ""you could do better"", ""if you didn't eat that or took one less spoon of serving, you'd be better off"",""why did I eat that"", ""purge it when u come back to your room"",""this is fine, but don't eat for 3 days now"". when how when is it going to end ?

I want one thing. at least my dream body, or to feel normal with food again. NOT stuck in the middle. 

I can get my dream body by starving yes, but bro i need to work, study, and i cannot just do that with just ciggarettes and coffee and water and cucumber and shit in me, I faint and feel awful.

Preventing Bloating Before Vacation,"Hello! I am deep in the thick of it and sort of losing my mind with panic. I'm so sorry if this sounds pro-ana, I swear it's not I'm just struggling right now and need some reassurance so I don't have bad body dysmorphia and freak out.

I'm going on vacation at the end of the week and I couldn't stop myself from wanting to fast the entire time leading up to it. Except that every time I eat, no matter what I eat, I bloat like crazy. I'm too afraid to not fast but I feel like that will all be for nothing if I look 6 months pregnant the entire time. 

So should I just low restrict leading up to it? Should I high restrict and work out three times the amount I usually do? Will fasting still be worth it because I'll be thinner overall? 

I already know how to generally treat bloating after it happens, but I want to prevent it in the first place. I already take every pro and prebiotic known to man, I eat slowly and plan on doing so on my trip, I go for a walk and do yoga asanas, etc etc etc. I just want to know if I start eating now will I gain weight and bloat on my trip anyway or will it help reduce the bloating so I don't absolutely hate my body while on vacation? Or will the weight gain get me either way?

Lack of Estrogen,"A few months ago I somehow slipped into really unhealthy restrictive eating habits. I had some sh problems at that time and always felt left alone at school. All of that + discovering the ed romanticising side of twitter led to developing an  even shittier coping mechanism. 

Anyway I am basically recovered by now but always had some small relapses. I  have visited a doctor because I haven't got my period in over 6 months, after that I made a blood test and they couldn't find any estrogen.

 Another info: I went vegan 2-3 months ago because I always felt so bad for the animals, I looked at many info's about nutrition so I could get all the nutrients I need, I also take my b12 supplement. My parents kind of blame veganism for this issue even tho they know about my issues with food and I'm afraid the doctors/dieticians I will be seeing will also think like this. I don't want to eat animal products again, not because of my ed but because I don't wanna hurt other living beings.

Has anyone here got similar health issues? And if any of you know any tips on how to handle this health state or this situation please tell me...

Sicker than I have been in time, and I no longer obsess over the sensation of touching my bones, or cupping my thighs, or wrists, or any of it for that matter.

What is your relationship with sugar?,"I am really conflicted and hoping for some perspective.

I've  been in recovery for a while, some issues but I've been pretty  consistent. I have noticed that I often overeat sugar when I eat  ""intuitively"" and it is MAJORLY stressing me out.

It  feels like my only options are 1) to eat without tracking, knowing that  refined sugars are designed to be addictive and knowing I will overeat  them, or 2) start tracking sugar intake/cutting out foods, and  inevitably spiral.

I already don't  eat candy or drink soda, or most baked goods because I have celiacs. I  just like sugar and cream in my oatmeal (so delicious btw) and maybe  something like ice cream a few times a week. It doesn't feel like a lot,  and it makes me happy, but it is objectively too much sugar by national  health standards. I guess I could switch to plain oatmeal in the  mornings, and that type of thing, but that kind of sucks.

I  think even a million grams of sugar per day is probably better for you  than starving, but I also know too much is detrimental to your health. I  feel guilty about how much of it I eat but I also don't want to deprive  myself of something satisfying and comforting. Does anyone else have  experience with this?

(btw I'm  talking about added/refined sugars, which are known to contribute to a  bunch of health problems, not sugar from stuff like fruit!)",163wrgu,9,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/163wrgu/what_is_your_relationship_with_sugar/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-28 20:17:29

"GF is struggling hard with extreme hunger, appealing for advice","My girlfriend has been battling anorexia since 2021 and for the past 16 or so months she's been on, overall, a very bumpy upward trend towards recovery. This is after hitting such a low point that she briefly ended up in a psychiatric facility to avoid ending herself.

She's gone from a starvation amount of calories per day at her worst to something around maintenance amounts or more regularly, plus vitamin supplements, and her physical health has improved a lot. And she's done a fair bit of psychological healing via therapy, but isn't out of the woods yet at all.

And in recent weeks she has recovered enough that she has entered the stage of extreme hunger. The lack of control over her eating and the resulting weight gain is destroying her emotionally. And she's caught in a cycle of over-eating, vomiting, and feeling despair and helplessness.

Does anyone have any tips to offer to get her through this? She's talking like she wants to give up and go back to starvation. Something needs to be done about this out-of-control hunger before she hits a breaking point.

Anybody else here deal with IBS that makes recovery that much harder?,"I've dealt with IBS dating back to age 8 or 9, which coincidentally was around the time I believe I developed extreme anxiety. I've seen a lot of ads regarding new ""research"" saying that IBS is more or less an issue of nerve sensitivity as opposed to food intolerances and gut health/lack thereof like I've believed in the past, which to me makes it sound like IBS is all just psychosomatic (or at least highly influenced by something like anxiety or depression). But at the same time I think it might be congenital/genetic cause a lot of my family deals with it too. (Or maybe we're all just a little mentally ill.)

Basically I'm wondering if anyone here deals with it and if you've found ways to calm yourself mentally and physically during a flare up. Cause for me, when I restrict, I flare up; when I eat good and think I'm listening to my body, I flare up -- just in different ways. It's gotten so much worse every time I've relapsed and I've had this disorder on and off for going on 12 years. Nothing has helped. It feels hopeless and while it's nowhere near the root cause of my ED, it sure makes the body dysmorphia and fear/control surrounding food a million times tougher to deal with.

Also if anyone knows of research regarding the longterm effects of AN on IBS and whether there is the potential for long term worsening of symptoms, please let me know.  üôè",161t4bu,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/161t4bu/anybody_else_here_deal_with_ibs_that_makes/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-26 11:50:07

"I think I‚Äôm developing an eating disorder, any advice on how to stop?","So, basically I was always someone who loved food, in all ways.
I had my little phases where I would eat less than usual mainly because of things like stress. But as of recently this issue became more serious and I don‚Äôt know what to do.


So when I‚Äôm at school I usually have my lunch packed. A couple of months ago I would‚Äôve eaten it whole maybe even complaining about not having enough and still being hungry afterwards.

But for a couple of weeks now, I found myself throwing it away after school everyday. And it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not hungry, my stomach hurts most of the time because of that but I just cannot get myself to eat something. Looking at my lunch makes me feel disgusted and sick. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm hungry but I don‚Äôt have any appetite, for weeks.

It‚Äôs come to the point where I‚Äôd have my first meal of the day at 10pm and not even that I can eat whole.

For example today, I made myself two small burgers which would usually make me excited and id eat both of them.

I forced myself to eat them both but felt disgusted the whole time. As I took the last few bites I actually almost got sick, even though this is a completely normal portion for me.

I just want to be able to eat normally again.

If anyone has any advice, please let me know",1618bbk,16,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1618bbk/i_think_im_developing_an_eating_disorder_any/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-25 19:14:13
I can‚Äôt save both of us,"Last night on a long car ride my mom and I got to talking. She told me food disgusts her. She told me she lost an extreme amount of weight. She told me she does not want to get better. 

Now I‚Äôm cooking for her, prepping her meals, begging her to eat. She looks at food I made with love with nothing but anger and disgust. She eats once a day.

I am so tired. I have been trying to keep afloat with my own eating disorder my whole life. She never even noticed to this day. I‚Äôve been struggling for months. I can‚Äôt help but have really complicated feelings about this. I‚Äôm even kind of angry way deep down.

I can‚Äôt do this. I need help. If you have any advice, please tell me what to do.

Osteoporosis and osteopenia,"Not sure if this is allowed but I figured you guys might want to know this.

I am currently working in a radiography clinic where we do DEXA BMD (bone mineral densiometry) scans. The DEXA part just refers to the type of machine it is. 

We scan the lumbar spine (low back) and the left hip. We use the scan to determine the density of the bone and to detect whether someone has osteoporosis or osteopenia.

Osteopenia: loss of bone mass or bone mineral density that is lower than what is expected for your age

Osteoporosis: a severe decrease in bone mass and mineral density resulting in structural changes

Both increase your risk of fractures like badly increase. You might cough and fracture something. You shrink. Severe back pain. Hunching of the back. 

Risk factors:
- older age
- female
- hormonal changes (pause in periods, early menopause before 45)
- diet (vitamin D, protein and/or calcium deficiency)
- rheumatoid arthritis
- smoking
- 3+ alcoholic drinks daily
- anorexia nervosa 

I recently had a patient (I will not be divulging any specific identifying information) who suffered from anorexia nervosa.

They had the worst score I‚Äôve seen so far in any patient. I‚Äôve seen old ladies (90+), I‚Äôve seen patients with chronic conditions that put them at higher risk and I‚Äôve seen early menopausal patients. I‚Äôve seen quite a few patients for this scan.

Recovery will not reverse their score. The treatment for osteoporosis or osteopenia is to try to stop it from getting any worse. There‚Äôs medications, exercises to build muscle, calcium and vitamin D rich diets. The best treatment is prevention. 

You can stock up on supplements all you want but don‚Äôt expect them to stop the progression of bone loss. Research into calcium supplements is inconclusive into whether they work. The best supplement you can get is none. Get it from your diet. 

Vitamin D and calcium work together to prevent bone loss. Vitamin D in your gut helps your body to absorb the calcium. Too little of either and your thyroid releases too much of their hormones leading to weakened bones (hyperparathyroidism).

Stay safe and feel free to correct any unintentional misinformation. To the best of my knowledge this is all correct.",160vgf5,8,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/160vgf5/osteoporosis_and_osteopenia/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-25 10:33:19

"I've recovered. But I want to go back to the eating disorder mentality I had before, without it affecting my physical health...","I literally recovered folks, it is possible.  
But I miss anorexia.  
I don't miss fainting constantly and being so hungry I had to hug my stomach praying the pain stops so I can just walk, I don't miss people telling me I looked sick, I don't miss the skeleton-like body.  
But I do miss the control it had over me, the discipline. I miss being happy that my weight was so low. And more than anything, I miss it controlling how I felt, I miss being that what I was worried about, not my current mental state where I don't give a flip.  
How can you miss something so harmful? I can eat without worrying at all about calories and shit, I'm pretty much recovered, I barely think about my weight, I don't cry because I'm a bit more chubby than I want to be because it doesn't matter, I'm beautiful.  
But I want to be controlled by it again... But I don't want to damage my body more. Does that make any sense?

I want to recover,"For the last few days the word skinny has overtaken my mind & I want to recover. I am no longer underweight, I was at my lowest weight 4 years ago & again just over 1 year ago. I truly wish I had never gotten there. If I hadn‚Äôt gotten so small, i wouldn‚Äôt know how great it was. It all started on accident as a result of being broke and depressed when i moved out of my parents. I lost half my body weight in a year and people loved it, they didn‚Äôt care how it happened or even ask, they just said I looked great. All. The. Time. Skinny privilege. 

I have struggled ever since then, going between getting close to that weight again via restriction and wanting to recover so I start focusing on protein and recovery. No matter what i‚Äôm doing, skinny is always on my mind. If my thighs touch, I hate myself. 

Does anyone really ever recover? So much so that the voice in their head doesn‚Äôt speak up anymore? I‚Äôve never believed it‚Äôs possible & i still don‚Äôt but I really hope it is. How do I actually recover?

Skinny shamed *again* by my own mother,"This is a rant nobody should be bothered reading - sometimes it just helps writing this crap down üò∂

 I‚Äôm staying at my mother‚Äôs right now, and she insisted on weighing me. Insisted.

Of course she flipped out - little did she know it‚Äôs not even my real weight. I get why she freaked, but why on earth does she then have to be cruel and downright nasty? She proceeded to skinny shame me, with ‚ÄúYou look horrible in a pair of skinny jeans‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too skinny, it‚Äôs unattractive‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople will think you‚Äôre anorexic, they‚Äôll talk about you behind your back‚Äù (hello - what do you think I am, mother?) and she went on and on, culminating in how the way I look results in not only damage to my reputation and opportunities, but hers. What‚Äôs also crazy is how when she‚Äôs watching tv, she‚Äôll point to models and actresses and say ‚Äúshe‚Äôs skinner to an you!‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs as skinny as you!‚Äù like this is somehow helpful?? I don‚Äôt know - she still doesn‚Äôt believe I have an ED, thank God.

And then she said that every time I stay with her she‚Äôs going to feed me full of one of my biggest fear foods - pasta and cream sauces.

So yeah. I love mums. So much fun. And I know I must sound embittered but right now I am. She‚Äôs made me paranoid about the way I look, she‚Äôs shamed and insulted my body, she‚Äôs triggered me regarding my weight, and she‚Äôs threatened me with food (as dumb as it sounds I know) she knows I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like‚Äù (or in my own words an afraid of).

DAE experiences REALLY bad period cramps after getting it back?,"
I am in semi-recovery for almost one year now, eating ""normally"", I may say, and got my period back 5 months after I first started it (I got my period back March this year). But now it is hurting as hell ‚Äî and there's way too much blood, much more than before. 

During 2020 I didn't get my period at all and between 2021-2022 I got for maybe 8-10 months (of 24 and not in a roll), but I still was restricting and it'd be maybe 2, 3 days. Now I get 9+ days (some more, some less) and my period cramps are too debilitating to the point I have to force myself to... Live. 

I know I'll have to see a doctor (and I'm making an appointment right now!) to see what's exactly the cause, but does anyone go/went through the same thing? Does it have some thing to do with my eating disorder or is something totally different from it? Is it my body taking its revenge on me? 

Any comment is welcome. Thank you!",15yfurr,4,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15yfurr/dae_experiences_really_bad_period_cramps_after/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-22 19:26:36
My only secret,"I‚Äôve always struggled with body image issues in my childhood but with age, it grew with me. It grew into something bigger than me. I am 23F and everyday I get worse. I feel myself wasting away but my thoughts don‚Äôt change. It makes me cry knowing how I truly feel inside and I have no one to express it to. Those who I‚Äôve HAD to tell depending on the situation, never bothered to ask about it again. Not their responsibility but it does take a toll knowing if they don‚Äôt care, why should I‚Ä¶.

Sometimes I feel the way I want to, and I‚Äôll wear a tight top. I‚Äôm unsure why she would say that, would she have said that to anyone else? Was it just for me? I took the minis because of the pressure and as I googled the calories, I ate 3. After finding out how many was in the serving, I threw the rest away. I remember every single calorie I eat. I can‚Äôt stop punishing myself for eating to survive. Penalizing myself for ‚Äúnutrition‚Äù even though I don‚Äôt see it that way.

Extreme hunger,"Hi 
What do people consider as extreme hunger? I‚Äôm 3 months into recovery and I‚Äôm still eating a lot. In the beginning of recovery I was eating 10-8k calories a day and now I‚Äôm eating around 4000 calories a 3 month into recovery. I‚Äôm scared that my extreme hunger will never pass and that it will take 4000 calories for the rest of my life to get full. Getting full from eating 2000-3000 calories a day seems so unrealistic and something I‚Äôm never going to be full from?

Any Dutch ppl on here?¬ø What can I expect from ED treatment?,"Title speaks for itself.
I have a so called 'diagnosis day'  where they'll run all sorts of tests on me and have conversations along with my family, I'll get my diagnosis and treatment advice at the end of the day. Just curious as of what I can expect from it, I've never actually been treated for mental health before and it makes me a bit nervous that I don't know what's exactly going to happen. Non-dutch ppl can comment too about their experience of course but I'm mainly interested in how treatment works here, can't really find specific information on the internet and it's better to hear it from someone who has actually gone trough it. 

I'm suspecting they'll give an anorexia diagonisz. either restrictive or purging idk, cuz I do purge but there's probably criteria on how frequently it happens and for me it comes and goes in periods. It's not sth that I do consistently, so could also be ednos maybe.

Can anorexia make you feel unmotivated?,"did you ever feel unmotivated and unable to accomplish anything while you had an Ed? Cuz right now I feel like I can't get anything done even the thing I once enjoyed. But sometimes I feel like my brain is deceiving me and using Anorexia as an excuse to be lazy if that makes any sense. I mean, when I think my procrastination and laziness are caused by anorexia, my brain convinces me that I'm alright and that I'm simply using anorexia as an excuse to feel less guilty about being lazy. I realize this seems strange, but I don't know how else to say it. I spent the entire day doing nothing. I'm also looking for a lot of jobs, but no one ever hires me, which is a separate story.

relapse (no triggers) would appreciate encouraging words/advice,"hello :)
first I‚Äôll start with some background: i‚Äôve struggled with orthorexia and anorexia for years and this last december i was forced into recovery. 
at first, I didn‚Äôt cooperate but eventually realized it would get me nowhere - and i realized I want to recover.
so I gained weight and ate my meal plan, stopped using laxatives and overall got better. there were obviously ups and downs but you know, I did it. and for a while I was actually doing better, ate out and ate however much I wanted. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I still had disordered behaviors and still restricted whenever I could but not as heavily as I used to and I maintained my weight. I would also like to add that I‚Äôm a female, I‚Äôm 19 and still live at home.
recently though, I had to stop overexercising due to poor physical health (i‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs related tbh) and I also started restricting heavily again. I also lost weight. 
the thing is, that I would‚Äôve totally let it go down bad again, but I can‚Äôt afford that to happen. I have plans for the near future and I can‚Äôt let myself get low again. I have a beautiful fianc√©e that cares about me and loves me, my family is overprotective and would definitely notice, my dietitian who I don‚Äôt want to disappoint, and I absolutely CANNOT go ip as it would fuck up everything i‚Äôm working for. 
I‚Äôm lost, and i don‚Äôt know how to stop it. i don‚Äôt WANT to stop it but I know I need to. 
I‚Äôm scared, I‚Äôm so deadly scared of gaining weight again, of every food to ever exist. i don‚Äôt fucking know how to stop this and i‚Äôm going crazy. 
if you read it all i‚Äôm so thankful, I would love advice/words of encouragement.

What is fullness?,"I wanna know if any of yall had strict parents with the rules of finishing food before leaving the dining table? I would be sat at my table from about 5 years old, till late into the night, until I had eaten or hidden my food till my plate looked clean. I now struggle to know when I'm full and it makes recovery hard because I go all or nothing.
Like if I have a food I feel obliged to eat it all because;
1. Starving children exist and id be a monster in the back of my head if I wasted the food
2.i hear my parents calling me a variety of names if I threaten to leave a single crumb.
3. Where I am rn you cannot hide food, not that these people mind you leaving food on plates but it feels like i'll get in trouble or yelled at 
4. I DONT KNOW IF IM FULL?  Idk how common this is but I haven't ever really experienced fullness. Obviously when I was a kid I would say I'm full 24.7 so I could try to escape meals, to no avail.. my parents and grandparents never let me leave food so now no matter the size of what I eat I dont feel full.
(Tw binge) for example earlier i think I should have felt full as I ate a large pizza, a family bag of popcorn, a family chocolate bar, pasta salad, a wrap and some crisps. I didnt feel full. I also had biscuits.

Relationship advice,"
I would really like some comments or advice for my current relationship.

My (21M) boyfriend (21M) struggles with anorexia. and has been bulimic in the past. He's very open and honest about his struggles and feelings which is really good for us both.

Personally, I have struggled with weight, but not disordered eating. A few years ago in highschool, I had dropped A LOT of weight due to being depressed and not leaving my room but my weight loss was not intentional. I hated how skinny I got, even tho I was now a healthy weight and no longer overweight. It freaked me out for so long because I had never intended on losing weight and at the time I wasn't 100% aware of what mental illness was. I would dream of gaining all the weight back just because I was happier mentally. i‚Äôm doing much better now and got diagnosed with bipolar type II and i‚Äôve just been on my journey to healing. 

Anyways, back to my point. I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to be there for my boyfriend 100% and I don‚Äôt know the right things to say sometimes. I‚Äôm still very supportive and helping as best as i can. I know that I can‚Äôt fix anything. it is just very hard for me to completely understand an eating disorder, because I struggled with the opposite perception of my body (sorta). Also, sometimes he does make little harmless jokes, calling me fat and obviously i don‚Äôt take it serious because i know im not fat at all. However, sometimes it‚Äôs hard for me to know if he actually is serious, and is  projecting his insecurities on to me. I feel like I could never bring these things up though, because i don‚Äôt wanna be a ‚Äútrigger‚Äù for him.  I just feel like this is a huge thing that needs to be dealt with soon because i am concerned for him and i also don‚Äôt want to start questioning my own body (i rlly hope that doesn‚Äôt sound selfish) I do truly love this man and want the best for us both!",15xrju8,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15xrju8/relationship_advice/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-22 01:59:47

‚ÄúAt least your not physically ill!‚Äù,"These past six months have been hell. I‚Äôve been restricting more than ever before, without losing weight. The few times I‚Äôve lost weight these past six months, it haven‚Äôt been a lot and only temporarily. Therefore, I‚Äôve continued restricting as much as possible. But for the past two weeks, I‚Äôve felt like crap. Both physically and mentally. My hands and feet turn blue whenever I get cold, and I get cold for hours by drinking cold beverage or being exposed to cold winds. I have headaches almost everyday, I get really bad spells of dizziness, my bones and muscles ache, and my heart skips beats. Additionally, my hair is thinning at the front, and I‚Äôve gotten a receding hairline. More than usual at least. I had my blood drawn a couple of months ago or so, and they all came back clear. Which again gave me motivation to continue with my restrictive eating habits. But it‚Äôs really discouraging that I can‚Äôt seem to lose any weight/every weight loss is short lived. Anyways, my therapist thinks I‚Äôm doing completely fine, since I‚Äôve actually GAINED WEIGHT. And when she weighed me today, I had gained again. Even though I practically ate air the entire weekend. I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all last night, because I was so hungry. Yet I still gained weight. I reported this weight gain back to my parents, because they want to keep updated on how I‚Äôm doing weight wise. I don‚Äôt know in exact numbers what I weigh, not that I would mention any numbers here anyways. But I usually just tell them wether or not I‚Äôve gained. When I texted my dad and told him that I‚Äôd gained, he responded with: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre physically well and able to live a normal life, and doing everyday tasks.‚Äù His response made me upset and I wrote to him that even though I‚Äôm categorized as physically well, I‚Äôm very unwell mentally. And I also told him that having AN isn‚Äôt any less severe just because one is weight restored. He then answered with: ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs better that you are physically well, rather than physically unwell and mentally unwell at the same time.‚Äù Argh, I‚Äôm still so mad!!! He doesn‚Äôt have a clue about my physical symptoms, and I most definitely do not feel physically fine. I‚Äôm not motivated at all to recover. I wasn‚Äôt motivated earlier today before I texted my dad either. But his claims triggered me, and now I‚Äôm just completely discouraged and I feel disgusted with myself.

Imagining my life without FBT brings up a lot of grief. Not sure how to move forward.,"I am feeling very sad and suicidal, as I have been for quite some time. I do not mean to depict FBT as inherently ""bad"", especially if you think it might be a helpful form of treatment. However, it hurt me badly. Trigger warning for mentions of self-harm, suicidality, eating disorder behaviors, etc.

My parents forced me in FBT last May, right when I graduated from high school. A lot has happened since then... many things I would rather not remember. Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if I had not gone through FBT and had instead pursued professional outpatient care with my current treatment providers instead.

I was medically stable at the time and generally willing to try new/fear foods in moderation (e.g., I bought cupcakes when grocery shopping with my mother and had one or two that week, and my family went out to eat around once per week). Maybe I would have learned to associate the occasional slice of pizza, cheesecake, etc., with something positive. Maybe I would have enjoyed the food from my Chinese heritage (*baozi*, dumplings, congee, etc.) again instead of associating all my fear foods and ethnic foods with mental breakdowns and the feeling of terrible bloating, nausea, sickness, and rapid forced weight gain.

Maybe there would be some lingering ED behaviors and thoughts, but I would be, overall, ""okay"". I would not have developed the unhealthy habit of spitting out my food because the way my parents plated my meals and snacks meant so much sugary, oily food that it made me sick... and even after spitting out a lot of food, I still gained weight at an unhealthily rapid rate and felt sick from the food I did swallow.

I would not have used unsafe methods to fake my weights, since my mother and the FBT treatment team expected me to be at a borderline overweight BMI incongruous with the conclusions made by ED dietitians I consulted outside the program. The habit nearly put me in a coma twice (so please, *please* do not do it), all the while being weighed by my mother twice a week. I would not have started self-harming to cope with the hurtful words said and my worsening suicidality... now, I have scars on my left arm and stomach. I would not have nearly attempted suicide twice.

Maybe I would have gone to college last year instead of being forced to take a gap year. Even if I ended up taking a gap year, I might have had a more enjoyable time. No more being weighed by my mother, insensitive comments about my eating and weight and how weight gain essentially cures my ED and depression. No more threats to my job, access to transportation, etc. Fewer power struggles about my medical rights as an adult. Maybe I would have taken a nice vacation overseas to Japan or to visit my relatives in China. Maybe my relationship with my parents (not the best before FBT but certainly reasonable) would not have deteriorated to the point where being around them triggers such severe avoidance, fear, suicidality, and mental instability.

Now, all I am is suicidal, mentally unwell, and so hurt that I do not know what to do anymore. I know, logically, staying at home is not a good idea, but I am so tired of living that going to college next week feels exhausting. I feel strangely old (probably because I am suicidal) and so, so sad. I am sad because of the things that have happened, but also because of what I have lost and what could have been.

GENUINE recovery influencer: Rain Boyd (reccomendation!!),"Hi, idk if this is allowed in this sub so feel free to delete if not but I wanted to share this recovery youtuber who I think is ACTUALLY a genuine recovery account and I've never heard others about her so I wanted to kind of give her a shoutout/reccomend her to others!!

It's Rain Boyd on youtube, her insta is Rainsrecoverie.
Like all the others, she records videos and makes posts about her ED but without all the triggering bullshit. I discovered her a while ago, her channel has been growing slowly overtime so she doesn't have that big of an audience yet which may be why I've never heard others about her before, hope this inspires some people tho check her out and get inspired by her. She's such a sweet and genuine person, really like her personality :D.

"should i go see a doctor? please help im worried, period loss(?)","im currently just coming out of a really intense restriction relapse a few weeks ago, but my period for the past 3 months has only bleed a tiny amount for 1 day and then it‚Äôs gone. not sure if that counts as amenorrhea or if it‚Äôs cause by ED at all. even at my lowest w31ght i still had my period, but now even at a higher one, its gone.

secondly, i‚Äôve upped my intake to MAINTENANCE for the past 3 weeks and gained weight. i dont know how thats possible, its just confusing to me. i know peiod loss slows your metabolism so i feel like it might be related.

Advice... my family is getting together and they trigger me... need advice!!!,"I'm currently in a really bad relapse and at my lowest... my lowest in terms of mental health and my lowest weight ever... needless to say I am not doing well... my family is getting together this Wednesday for my niece's and sister's birthdays and last time I saw my family was back in April. Last time I saw them my other sister (not the one who's birthday it is) gave me nasty/dirty looks ever time I talked to her about everything/all n8ght for no reason. My mother was also ""sneaking"" food in the kitchen because God forbid she's seen eating more than the little bit on her plate she'd be a ""pig"" (*her words not mine). Both my sister and my mother triggered the crap out of me and on my way home I was a complete mess, thankfully my husband was driving but he had to deal with me breaking down and calling myself horrible things... my breakdown went on for days if not weeks after my visit. My family hasn't said a single thing to me about my relapse and it's clear as day what I'm going through! My sister (the one who was giving me dirty looks) both myself and my husband took care of her all last year when she was going through cancer treatment, so I was extremely hurt by her behavior/looks at dinner. No one in my family was caring or supportive in the past when I was struggling with ED/anorexia, rather I am told I am a ""drama queen"" lol I literally am the furthest thing from that but everyone is allowed there opinion... I know that it is in my best interest not to go over this Wednesday and that it will only bring trouble but I feel like an a%%hole not going, especiallywithit beingmy niece'sbirthday...  I don't know what to do... I've talked it out with my husband and he thinks it is in my best interest not to go....

Giving up on recovery,7 months ago I went to an inpatient recovery center and I was determined to take care of myself and gain the weight I lost back.

I‚Äôm still underweight and less than I was before my relapse but god it‚Äôs so hard to stay motivated. I‚Äôve just kind of accepted how skinny I still am at this point because I don‚Äôt have the energy to eat anymore and I maybe get one good meal in per day. I‚Äôm not actively restricting I‚Äôve just given up. My family still thinks I‚Äôm too thin. Is it okay to just be okay with this and to stop trying.

Not awesome realizations,"I‚Äôm laying in bed like I always do day after day for the past few months realizing I don‚Äôt even have the brain capacity to be a human when I don‚Äôt eat and don‚Äôt eat right.

It‚Äôs kind of scary when you realize what you‚Äôre doing to yourself with the other coping mechanisms you lean on and then the lack of nutrition you‚Äôre causing for your body.

i really want to go bc i miss my friends but im very anxious 

i want to text my friend something to say im scared about this but i want to go but i dont think i can handle any potentially triggering conversation topics and even people offering food or talking about food can be really triggering (but its a potluck so kind of inevitable) 
but if i text her she'll know i have problems and she might not believe me bc my bmi is considered healthy and i'll be so spoiled and whiny asking for people to tiptoe around it

what‚Äôre your opinions on this? is it a good idea to keep an eye on my calories, because it feels odd to not know exactly what i‚Äôve eaten. i‚Äôm
honouring my cravings, but counting them. or is this a bad idea?

I am not sure why I should continue to live... I am tired of my mind. I have been suicidal for years.,"I (19F) have had anorexia for five years and depression and suicidality for at least seven. I hate myself so much -- my body, my personality, the trouble I cause my parents by having this illness and not pursuing ""full recovery"". I hate that I should love my parents, but there is so much pain... when I am around them, I easily become suicidal and break down mentally. I hate my selfish thoughts and privilege.

I hate that, despite anorexia being an illness that has isolated me in high school, caused health problems, etc., I cannot easily let go of it completely. I am afraid that, when it disappears, all this self-loathing will implode and kill me directly. Somehow, anorexia is my way of coping... of asking someone to please care for me, love me... for me to feel smaller and younger (both of which I associate with happier times).

My mind is a mess. Sometimes random details or changes in the atmosphere (light, location, sound, etc.) trigger bad memories and/or phrases my family said in the past like a broken record. They mix in with my own voices of self-hatred. 10 months of FBT left a lot of scars, too. I am tired of being so torn up and sad, of being incapable of caring for myself... of it all being my fault.

I am scared of college... scared of the new environment and this destructive self-image. I am terrified of losing my academic achievements since classes are so difficult. Without a good personality, academics were almost all I had in high school. I cannot bear living as myself. I am scared of being rejected and scorned, for people leaving me once they know of my mental conditions. I am sad that anorexia is genetic... that I am not sure anyone will come to love me without so much hurt. I am afraid I will never learn how to love someone else.

I just want to be ""normal"" and live an ordinary, peaceful life, but my mind is scrambled from the fear, pain, and sorrow. It feels much deeper than depression, but I am not sure what it is. I wish someone could help.",15u7gx3,26,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15u7gx3/i_am_not_sure_why_i_should_continue_to_live_i_am/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-18 02:22:21

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm anorexic. Am I? I‚Äôm just exhausted rn :(,"Hello guys, 

I was underweight for my entire life. I never had a normal body weight. As a teenager I was at my lowest point, just skin & bones. I was always very concerned about my low weight. I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin, that I even wore long trousers & tops to cover my anorexic looking arms on the hottest summer days. 
Even though I HATED being severely underweight & people constantly staring at me, I could not gain even a kg.

I can‚Äôt see, how I‚Äôm supposed to have anorexia, as I basically have NO typical anorexia symptoms: I never restricted eating, I never felt being too fat. I know that I just don‚Äôt / didn‚Äôt look normal. Why would she diagnose me with anorexia? I have also recurrent depression & generalized anxiety disorder. 
I also feel hopeless, as after 1 year of therapy I‚Äôm still not able to gain weight: I‚Äôm seriously suffering, as I basically miss out on life: dating with anorexia ist difficult (I mean I still get guys, but im so ashamed of my body‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt want them to see me naked), I am constantly exhausted, zero energy, almost never meet friends.

How do y‚Äôall discuss Anorexia with your SO?,"Hey y‚Äôall,

Hope you‚Äôre doing well!

I wanted to reach out and get some advice. My boyfriend has known me for 3 years now, but we only recently started dating. We‚Äôve been long distance this entire time, but when I was at my lowest and went to outpatient, I confided mainly in my support group there and not my him/my friends (I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall can guess why). To make things worse, I have ARFID on top of Anorexia, so I have really struggled. When we‚Äôve been together, he has not judged me at all for my struggles and he does his best to make sure we both eat. He really tries his best. 

Unfortunately, my Anorexia has really gotten the best of my recently and I‚Äôve started restricting and then eating normally and I sling-shot between the two. My boyfriend does his best to be supportive, but he does not have an ED so he can‚Äôt relate. I normally don‚Äôt tell him about my EDs because I don‚Äôt know how to even properly express myself. I know he wants to know, I just‚Ä¶.feel so ashamed, you know? But i want to properly express myself and my worries, but just don‚Äôt super know how to approach it. Does anyone have any advice???

Help with Binging,"I was diagnosed with atypical anorexia 4 months ago by eating disorder specialists. I was heavily restricting my food intake and got down to my ideal weight of 165lbs. However, now that I have been in treatment with the eating disorder specialists, I have been gaining weight and dropping a lot of the restrictions I had around what I ate and when I ate. I feel as though my discipline around eating and maintaining my ideal weight is being lost, I just don‚Äôt have the will power anymore to avoid high calories foods. Due to this, I believe my atypical anorexia is now turning into binge eating disorder. This is because now that so many of my restrictions and restrictive behaviours that kept me at a healthy body weight have been lost due to the eating disorder program and my overall willpower going down. Now I have huge binge eating sessions where I end up eating massive amounts of high calorie food that adds up to around 8,000-10,000cal. These behaviours never used to happen as I had the willpower to avoid these foods and maintain not over eating, but now I just can‚Äôt seem to have the discipline around food and I just give in. I now weigh 185lbs which is 20lbs more than I want and I can‚Äôt seem to stop gaining or binging and the eating disorder program isn‚Äôt helping. What can I do to get myself under control again and get the discipline to get back to 165lbs?",15t2sbl,9,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15t2sbl/help_with_binging/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-16 21:31:35

Looking for advice,"Hey everyone!! 
This is my first time posting here so please bear with me... (I've read all the rules and am hoping this follows them) 

So I'm currently in a DBT program for my anorexia among other things and I have about a month left of group and then another 2 months-ish of individual  we've started thinking about what comes next and I basically have two options... 

I can continue my eating sort of as is ( fasting more days than not ) and be referred to ED Services who probably won't even accept (which I would then likely have no support) because Ive done the program once and been referred several more times to them on top of that, that they've denied in the past. Or I can be eating everyday and do a further 6 months of individual therapy with my current therapist but the anorexia needs to be under control. 

I have decided I'm going to aim to be eating everyday ( because either way that's inevitable and I'd like to continue with my current therapist to work on the other things) but I'm struggling immensely with the guilt, distress, anxiety etc. and looking for how others have gotten through this ? For context I live alone so I have to be the one to get myself to eat, there's no one to encourage me. 

I have been hospitalised before and been fed through an NG and this whilst distressing was more manageable to get into that regular eating because 1. I'm not tasting the food 2. I could do it whilst asleep and not have to push through as much distress and once it's regular slowly introduce food... But I don't know if this is an okay thing to try in the community? I feel guilty for even thinking about suggesting that...

In a relationship with someone with an eating disorder,"i‚Äôm in a serious relationship (now 1yr) with someone who has suffered with an ed on and off. He has started spending some time with my family recently. My family is really important to me. The moments when we are all truly together is around the dinner table. My boyfriend was unable to bring himself to the table for dinner when I invited him to stay with us at the lake. He‚Äôs uncomfortable eating in front of other people. He is new to the family so when he skipped out on dinner it was hard to explain away. If we are going to be serious I want to invite him to more family gatherings. However if he can‚Äôt be at the table with me it presents a challenge. They all love him but it can be hard for some people to understand why someone wouldn‚Äôt want to come sit with them. Dinner is usually 2 hours, usually we stay and talk even after we eat. Is he going to run off every time we come together at the table? Unfortunately, it makes me think twice about inviting him to future family gatherings. That might be a barrier in our relationship. I just don‚Äôt know how to handle this. I know his issues have resurfaced the past few weeks but he doesn‚Äôt really get into it. I‚Äôm ok with that. I told him I support him and i‚Äôm always here to listen if he wants to talk. I hate to see him suffer and I feel guilty even thinking about my feelings on this. I‚Äôve struggled with mental health and some body insecurity but not with an ed.

How do I know when I need to ask for a doctors help?,"to start - i have always been a bit on the chubbier/bigger side, have dealt with anorexia throughout most of my life on and off, my therapist diagnosed me this year with anorexia due to my restricting (as far as i know, my doctors do not know abt this diagnosis)

the past few weeks i have been eating less and less, but this past week i cannot seem to get much at all down. i feel so nauseous whenever i get hunger pains that i can't bring myself to eat when i am hungry. thinking about food makes me nauseous. smelling any food makes me nauseous to the point where i have to physically walk away from the plate. i've never been at this point before so i don't really know what to do. i've been getting dizzy lately anytime i move too fast, especially when i shower (i feel the closest to possibly fainting in the shower), and i've never experienced dizziness from my anorexia in the past.

it's scaring me a little bit but its hard because i like the fact that i am loosing weight. this year i've lost a lot of weight so far and i see my doctor consistently due to medication check-ins (im 20, still with my pediatrician) and my weight loss has not been mentioned once by my doctor once.  i feel like since i started in a bigger body and my weight loss is seen as something congratulatory the doctor doesn't see a problem, so i dont necessarily want to stop the problem, ya know?

essentially, i just want to know if dizziness is a big indicator or anything that i should contact my doctor and begin trying to take recovery seriously a bit (a lot) more. i very much so don't want to and i just want to see what like-minded individuals who have experienced this have to say. i am also very curious if anyone else has experienced intense nausea from the thought and scent of any food? its the biggest thing that is preventing me from trying to get any genuine help right now (i have a severe phobia of throwing up, so forcing myself to eat while nauseous is something i'm just not willing to do right now unless i'm convinced otherwise really).

anything anybody has to say is greatly appreciated. i've never posted or spoken to anybody about this outside of my therapist and i think itll be nice to hear perspectives from others that are dealing with the same thing. <3 <3

Relapse‚Ä¶don‚Äôt know if I will be able to come back from it this time.,"TW: trauma/abuse

*
*
*

The past few years my anorexia b/p subtype got the worst it‚Äôs ever been; the lowest weight I‚Äôve ever been, mostly due to a a long abusive relationship that came to a head with a severely traumatic domestic violence incident, which the anniversary of is creeping back up in about a week. I nearly died in January after being found passed out on my bathroom floor for about 16 hours - my body temperature was 90, they had to intubate me and give me chest compressions. I was extremely underweight, but even without inpatient or formal treatment, something in my body just made me eat and keep it down. I gained a massive amount in a short period, up to around a healthy weight. As much as my ED didn‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôm glad I did, because I‚Äôve had gastrointestinal problems a few times since where I couldn‚Äôt even keep water down, and accidentally lost some‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶that and the reminder of my abuse and trauma coming up has triggered me. I‚Äôm so worried. I‚Äôve now lost about half of what I had put on. And I know it‚Äôs a slippery slope to just keep going & lose the rest‚Ä¶but then I‚Äôll be right back where I started, a half-dead ghoul that can barely walk - only it would be worse because my body will be weaker. I can‚Äôt keep cheating death. I‚Äôm trying to be easy on myself because I know this trauma has a lot to do with my mental state, but don‚Äôt want to give myself a pass, either. I‚Äôm in therapy but it‚Äôs not really helpful; they mean well but don‚Äôt know a lot about EDs. Inpatient or even PHP isn‚Äôt a financial option for me. 

I don‚Äôt know if I want advice to help myself or to just scream into the void. Regardless, I‚Äôm so sad that so many of us are struggling, and super proud of those that have overcome this nightmare. ‚ô•Ô∏è",15qyhhv,10,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15qyhhv/relapsedont_know_if_i_will_be_able_to_come_back/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-14 15:51:45

Thank you for sharing your struggles. It's very comforting to read your posts and to know I'm not alone.,"I'm spiraling - hard. I'm so hard on myself. I thought I'd be through with this as I'm an (albeit young) adult and have been dealing with this bullshit since the day I could eat on my own... But no. 

I have some extremely unhealthy coping mechanism, particularly C&S, anything over a very small amount of calories terrifies me. All day, every minute, is just food and numbers. I'm basically a walking, talking scale/calculator this point. 

I'm incredibly fucking frustrated because the last bit of weight just won't come off, no matter what I do - although I'm in the upper half of my healthy BMI and it should be possible. 

I'm very scared. When will my organs have enough? I basically eat like a toddler. I'm constantly dizzy, feel weak, tired. Memory loss. I don't know how much longer my body can take it. Just a bit longer, just a few more kilos until I am where I want to be at... 

We all know this is a lie. Maybe I will never be free. This disease is taking everything I am and turning it into a crotesque caricature of a person. Everything is tainted. 

Yet I can't let go. I just can't. I feel a sick sense of pride anytime I ""win"" over my body, like I have to prove to myself that I'm in control over it - although we are literally fighting the same fight. Part of me wonders whether the endgoal isn't control or ""proving"" myself... It's to ultimately vanish, to turn into thin air. 

Nobody knows. I have a big network, I'm just so fucking ashamed (just for all the wasted food alone, God...). It's too complicated to explain, too fucked up, too disgusting. They wouldn't understand, or worse - push me into forced recovery. My partner knows more than other people and thankfully, they are very understanding, very supportive as in they make an effort to not trigger me. But that can only go so far and it's my issue to deal with, not theirs. I lead a double life. I'm a liar.

But I'm sure I don't have to explain. Because you get it. It's scary to see myself in almost every post on here, but at the same time, I find comfort in the fact that I'm not alone. I'm very sorry you all are struggling, and I commend your courage to share your stories.

I take a laxative for my ibs and I haven‚Äôt abuse them in a while. However, along with my dicyclomine, I took a lot A LOT of miralax. Like three servings. It‚Äôs an hour later, I‚Äôm sitting in bed and crying because my stomach hurts, I feel tired and nauseous and my I have a sort of throbbing pain in my ribs. I know I‚Äôll be okay later but I also know that I fckedup my recovery. I‚Äôve never taken this amount of laxatives before today. I feel like I could shit my pants and throw up all at once. I hate it. God WHY CANT I JUST BE NORMAL AND ENJOY FOOD AND WHY THE HELL CANT MY BODY JUST LOOK OKAY. I don‚Äôt really care what other people think about my body but every fucking day, I step outside and my thighs rub together in this horrible summer heat. I try to hide my arms because I have granny wings and I‚Äôm fucking 19. My boobs are heavily deflated like I had ten children. I‚Äôm a mess. I might just sleep in the bathtub tonight.

Can't get away,"I've injured myself from over-training in running. So, I need to take time off from that to heal. I'm finding the idea so stressful because:
1. Running was making sure I had enough calories to fuel, and I'm concerned that this time off is going to just make me cut right back. 
2. I'm TERRIFIED of gaining weight due to suddenly not being able to burn off as much. I seriously can hardly walk currently. My friend told me I looked like i had put a tiny bit on yesterday (she meant it in a good way but I've been panicking since).

declining further.,"

*tw everything*


I have long avoided something acknowledging my own fault in this disease, nor have I vented about my disease online, in all fairness and guilt, I have usually promoted it to others to ease my own sick mind. The days of this psyche being attractive and quirky, have past, the days of it being concerning to others have passed, the days of it being concerning to myself have past. I have lost interest gaining further formal knowledge and keeping up with things that associate with eds, along side the communities tethered to them. Though, *I* have stayed sick the entire time‚Ä¶   I simply cannot win. I believe I have waited too long, burned far too many bridges, and have lost too much health and mind to invest in my future, nor am I necessarily interested in such. From my organs dying, upward - my teeth are falling apart, my gums are diseased, my throat is scarred and burnt, my voice is barely hanging on, and heart is waiting for a moment to give out. I spent years in storms of self harm threats, yet I don‚Äôt speak to anyone in any capacity anymore, no one gets it from the source, I am simply keeping this to myself. 
It seems unavoidable to not address while speaking as dramatic as this, I am overly aware I am most-likely not surviving this kind health for the near future. Between 6+ years of constant substance use, a revolving door of extreme restriction relapses, and throwing up damn near everything I have ate since, it seems there is too much, too much that is now permanent. I can only speak through an internet voice box, but I couldn‚Äôt be any happier if any of you were safer with this practise, please don‚Äôt mistake yourself like I did, for as long as I did. *Let it* be a *phase* that you work yourself out of, that your grow and blossom from, *be* alarmed when you start throwing up the blood in the toilet after purging, please listen to your body, you are gambling with your lives, I promise. I promise, I have given an infinite number of offerings to this disease, none of which hold any worth knowing what I know now. I know it hurts, it has always hurt, for me, and for you, more than I could ever understand, so I won‚Äôt give an attempt, so please, value yourselves, value health, value your mind.",15qlmh3,8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15qlmh3/declining_further/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-14 05:38:15

"recovering anorexic, usually can‚Äôt eat even when i try","I used to be morbidly obese. When I was 20, i went to my annual physical. I accidentally saw my weight at the top right corner or my discharge paperwork and everything fell apart. I always knew i was fat, but the high dosage of medication i was on at the time was obviously very helpful in the body dysmorphia realm, because even being the fattest girl in school, the hatred of my body then, couldn‚Äôt even begin the compare to now.
294 pounds. 20 years old with a BMI of almost 50. imagine that. 
when i told my parents that night, because i was being pressed for details, my dad laughed at me. i know he wasn‚Äôt trying to make me feel bad, maybe it was just a nervous laugh. but in that moment, for the first time, i pushed my not empty plate away from me and left the table hungry. it was in that moment that i decided, i didn‚Äôt need to keep eating. my body had enough fat to lose that any weight loss would be healthy right? 
wrong. 
fast forward 3 years. i am a regular at my local clinic. i have gone through a plethora of help problems and my brain was mush for so long. i am now a size small / medium, size 8-10. the pro ana‚Äôs out there are probably laughing but, i used to be a 4XL and a size 24 pants. i now weigh 132 pounds and i cannot seem to stop losing. I don‚Äôt want to lose anymore. My body is still deformed, just in a different way. My boobs and butt are gone, although i‚Äôve got some sick ass collar bones and a really good jawline. never thought those bones even existed for me. 
anyway. i have no way of getting real nutrition anymore. rarely i will get an appetite that lasts long enough for me to find something to eat. most times, it‚Äôs gone before i can even think of what to make. 
my goal is to start going to the gym to gain muscle and try to tone the loose skin. it‚Äôs tragic really, there‚Äôs a chance i would be underweight now if i could get rid of this hanging fat. 
i know when vegetarians go back to meat that sometimes their bodies can‚Äôt handle it anymore and reject it and they can‚Äôt ever go back. i‚Äôm scared that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened to me with chicken for example.

I'm not underweight, far from it, in fact if I gain weight now I'd be obese again.

I hate myself and my body.,"To preface, I am a male. I have anorexia binge-purging sub-type, and my life is a nightmare. I am also a major loner, and often lock myself in my room for most of the day so that I don't have to see anyone, or have them see me. I hate talking to people, and find it exceptionally tiring to do so. I am also about to go to university.

I am so scared for school. I will be sharing a room with another person, and I don't know how I am going to survive it. I often rock quietly to calm down or rub a towel against my face, and that is how I calm down at night, and I feel like I'll be too embarrassed to do this with someone else near by. However, I can't calm down without these behaviours.

Furthermore, where the AN-BP comes into play, I have very rigid behaviours around food. Further complicating this, I hate eating in front of people. I can't describe why, but it is the most uncomfortable feeling. Like ""someone is watching me use the loo"". But I am sharing a space with 10 other people, so I don't even know how I am going to bloody eat in this situation.

To top this off, anytime I see a girl who looks somewhat similar to me, it is almost a painful sensation, a mixture of jealousy and sharp, painful sadness. I want to be them, but I know that I never can be. I have struggled with this silently since I was a little kid. However, I realised in middle school that this wasn't normal, but I convinced myself that I was simply being a kid with too much internet access and that this wasn't an actual problem, so I never told my parents.

I am miserable because I know that if I had just told my parents about my problems when I realised that I hated my body when I was in middle school, I would have had the necessary support for my issues from a young age, but now, I am old enough that I feel like a lost cause, like there is no point seeking help because my problems are too deeply ingrained.",15prjgl,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15prjgl/i_hate_myself_and_my_body/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-13 06:34:18
my family friend's photo of me eating ice cream is triggering my ed,"Hi, reddit. This is my first reddit lost.

I labeled this NSFW because there's small mentions of my (kind of) past anorexia. 

I (17f) am trying to recover from anorexia. About 3 months ago, I was visiting my brother (35m), and his friend who considers himself to my brother, too (26m) has this thing where he takes photos of people to make funny stickers on whatsapp.

The whole time I was visiting my brother and his wife (37f), which was 4 months, they were calling me ugly, so I feel like I can't trust them. When I told them that I had anorexia, they (expecially my SIL) started calling me fat and making fun of me. 

Sometime in that, my brother's friend took a candid photo of me eating ice cream. I tried to be okay for so long, but it kills me on the inside. 

(TW: insecurity and *norexic thoughts)

I feel so hurt knowing that people have photos of me eating ice cream. It triggers my anorexia, and remembering that they have a photo of me eating ice cream makes me want to never eat again until I'm all bones. 

(*norexic thoughts over)

What should I do? I feel like the photos of me eating ice cream are prohibiting me from receiving properly.

When do u give up,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed for 6 years. I‚Äôve tried so many different things, programs, therapists, have been hospitalized, etc and nothing has worked long term. The only way I‚Äôm not constantly triggered is if I stay home and do nothing. I can‚Äôt just do that because I have a job and a life. That being said, I‚Äôve learned to live with anorexia. After my second recovery attempt (I‚Äôve had 4 attempts) I decided to not cut out different kinds of foods anymore and just restrict when my brain felt I needed to. So in this way I‚Äôm still able to eat with people, go out for meals, not stress about ingredients, etc. I also don‚Äôt fast anymore so even when I‚Äôm restricting I eat 3 meals a day, even if it‚Äôs the smallest portion. So during the day I‚Äôm able to somewhat have energy to work and socialize. I don‚Äôt like to think that I‚Äôm ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù ever recovering, but it really really isn‚Äôt working for me.

Anorexia and addiction,"I've struggled with addictions to weed and more recently stimulants for the last 3 years. On my last binge I fainted and pulled a muscle because I hadn't eaten. I'm 40 days sober but lots of bad feelings are coming to the surface. 

The more I deconstruct my relationship with drugs I realize it's almost entirely related to my disdain for eating. It was there in high school, but wasn't truly an issue until I got older. 

I feel sick everytime I eat, like it kills all my energy and momentum. When I finally get so weak I have to eat, it feels like I can't do anything. 

Close to a year ago I started working more and excercising less, and started gaining weight. I was already using stimulants but they weren't truly a problem until then. It's so dumb because it's only a few pounds, but if I can't see my ribcage I feel useless. I'm scared if I gain anything people will notice. 

It feels so inescapable, whether it's the weight gain, the way it grounds me, just the feeling. If I stop using drugs I have to eat, if I stop eating I have to use drugs (which feels better but hurts me). 

I really don't express these feelings to anyone. I don't judge anyone else as harshly as I judge myself and I don't want them to think that I am. There's something that feels weak in admitting that food is my biggest enemy, especially when they know my issues with substance abuse. It almost feels more embarrassing. 

Even going back as far as High School, it feels like the clean feeling from not eating is the original high. I want to feel like that all the time. And at this point, it's like I don't remember what healthy feels like. My body hates me no matter what I try.",15pfr60,19,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15pfr60/anorexia_and_addiction/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-12 21:11:53

Why I finally chose recovery,"So this is something I could write so much about but I‚Äôll say it briefly: I chose my recovery because of my deteriorating health. I realised I do NOT want to d*e. All this time I thought I was the exception, that my ED couldn‚Äôt possibly hurt me so bad, but it did and it has.

I became so frustrated when I found out I‚Äôm anaemic, have low immunity, possible PCOS, terrible mood swings, and worst of all: Amenorrhea. I got sick of waiting for my period to come, waiting for the pills to work, just waiting for my body to function the way it did before.

Being skinny is so not worth it. I don‚Äôt want to be skinny if it means feeling dizzy at times and not having a healthy brain. I‚Äôm done hurting my body and treating it like shit when it has done nothing but support me and keep me alive.

I‚Äôm choosing recovery for myself and for my body, and for my family who watched me suffer. I really hope I win this time üíïüíï

Please know you are not alone and you are not the exception. It doesn‚Äôt take long for your ED to go south and completely wreck your body and your life.

Feel like I don‚Äôt belong in residential,"Don‚Äôt know if this will be taken down soon but in the past 2 months my disorder, routines, and obsessive behavior regarding my disorder has practically taken over my life and I was persuaded by my family and friends to be admitted to a residential treatment center. It took a lot out of me to accept that I need professional help, that I will most definitely need to gain to recover, and that I would be consuming more food in treatment than I do at home. 
I‚Äôm going on to my third day of the program and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I don‚Äôt belong here. The amount of food they‚Äôre feeding me is quite ridiculous and tbh less than I consume at home. Normally, my intake was little to nothing during the day and then all of what I allowed myself to eat at night so I guess you could say I definitely volume ate. Here, I‚Äôm being served less food with more nutrition. For example todays breakfast was 1 French toast stick, half a yoplait yogurt, water. Lunch was half a cheese sandwich and a handful of grapes with water. dinner was about 12 pieces of penne with oil and peas with water. They don‚Äôt have me participate in morning snack like others and only have me eat 1 other half portion snack at night which is like a graham cracker w peanut butter. I feel like because I‚Äôm not struggling to finish the single French toast stick they give me, I‚Äôm not sick enough to be here. The other new girls are refusing mostly all of it. It makes me severely uncomfortable to sit next to a girl who‚Äôs smaller than me who refuses to eat a bite of food while I‚Äôm here feeling gross and invalid because I might want to finish my whole 12 pieces of pasta after all day long of baby snacks lol. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I came in here fully prepared and ready to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù and eat food that made me uncomfortable. But it seems to be extremely small quantities for lots of cals. And although the surplus of cals is making me uncomfortable, I feel like I‚Äôm not being challenged like I should be because in the real world, I think people are eating more than this. I honestly think a toddler is eating more than this. Again, it might be the volume eating thing that‚Äôs getting to me because usually I starve all day and only look forward to my giant salad at night. 
They told me that I do need to put on weight in order to recover at my meeting today so I know that they at least think I should be here.",15nwwhc,15,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15nwwhc/feel_like_i_dont_belong_in_residential/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-11 03:02:29

Long term damage is catching up to me and I'm at a loss,"*tw for mentions of death, hospitalization, symptoms talked about, and especially tw for mentions of death from this disorder*

I don't want to get better, but I don't want to be a cautionary tale of what this does to people. I'm tired of crying on the floor because I ate ""too much"" and disassociating. I don't think I'm at risk of passing away from this,  sometimes I'm scared my body will give out from the repeated abuse and neglect. I don't want to worry my people, I don't want to end up like that. 

I'm going to spare the details that aren't relevant. I developed disordered eating at 7y/o, and that transitioned to anorexia norvosa at 12. 3 years later I physically recovered (weight restored at 15). Three more bouts over the past 6 years, I've spent 1.5 years of that time trying to recover. Currently I'm in the trenches with it. 

I'm 24 now, and I'm afraid after destroying my organs, starving my thinkin meat, and making myself miserable for so many years this is when my  body will give out. 
I know how shitty i felt before. It's different this time for me. I went through rapid weightloss May-now. I didn't mean to loss it first. my ex and I had broke up. I felt out of control and yall know how detrimental control can be. 

I'm at the worst I've ever been. I can't eat in front of people, I stand in front of the mirror up to an hour at a time sometimes just poking and pinching and scrutinizing myself. I'm obsessed with myself in the worst way. I cancel plans, I'm isolated. Out of fear. It's awful every time people see me when they haven't recently. The look of shock, concern, and sometimes jealousy shakes me to my core. Idk how much I'd weigh if I got on a scale but I refuse that because it'll make it worse. 

My physical state is what I'm worried about most. Bradycardia has returned full force. I see black when I stand up, my blood pressure is in the toilet. I stumble, trip and honestly I do fall occasionally. The shower is the worst for that. I know these are common symptoms, but they're getting dangerous. I lose vision (idk if that's directly related tbh, my eyes refuse to focus randomly). Memory loss, chronically feeling flu like, with hair loss. There are so many little symptoms that I can't list them. (The usual purple nails, poor circulation, cold all the time etc) 

Everyone knows I'm not okay, nobody has said anything besides my ex. We're on good terms thankfully, and she almost cried when we spent time together after breaking up. She blames herself for my relapse but that isn't the case. Anything would of pushed me regardless. It's hard for her, she's never seen me like this. 
When we hug I feel her hand go down my spine, trying to tell how bad it's getting. No other partner I've had cared like she does. Lots of love and support for each other now, she's my safest person. We don't speak right now, nothing bad happened though. 

Towards the folks who have been through this stage of disorder please be honest. Give it to me raw. Im also hesistant because it can be triggering to tapk about, but if anyone knows someone who passed from an ED would you be willing to share their story? Not every detail of course.  I need a reality check of how this ends when you don't recover. 

(I'm aware of the statistics. I know the numbers and percentages. I read the DSM5 several times for these disorders, I can read all the facts. But we all know its also skewed because you have to meet the disorder BMI cut off for AN. People are turned away from treatment and are told ""come back when you're sicker"" while they can be at risk of death or a medical emergency regardless of weight. There's more to learn about EDs, and hopefully we get a glimmer of what's going on within us. And the support and treatments we need)",15nfs9a,10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15nfs9a/long_term_damage_is_catching_up_to_me_and_im_at_a/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-10 15:36:48

Hi please can I have someone to talk to?,"Hello, hello

first of all here's some context: I have been living with anorexia for  quite a few years but was only diagnosed around three years ago when I was  already at end stage. I then had to gain enough weight to go back to school however I have lost quite a bit since then. I'm still underweight but am not comfortable  with gaining any more.

I'm extremely sensitive to triggers and really struggle with comparing myself to others - if I see anyone that I view as ""competition"" it affects me really severely and continues to do so for days.

Does anyone else in recovery,This sounds awful but whenever things get hard in recovery I tell myself that in a few years when everyone is less worried and I'm not being monitored I can always relapse. It's kind of reassuring to know that I can always lose all the weight I gained later in life. I'm doing really well in recovery at the moment and I know it's a toxic ed thought that would bring me nothing if I acted on it but it's almost comforting to know that it's an option and I could easily go down the same path again.,15n6szb,23,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15n6szb/does_anyone_else_in_recovery/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-10 08:50:40

Anyone else disabled/ chronically ill?,"(Cross posted)
Is anyone else disabled/chronically ill?
I'm a full time wheelchair user. I get really jealous of others who can walk etc, because the only way I can loose weight is by restricting, whereas others can walk etc to help with weight loss. Also, due to the fact that I'm in a wheelchair, my TDEE etc is a heck of a lot lower than others, which means I have to restrict even lower than others.
I'm also currently on the verge of being admitted to inpatient (it will be happening sooner rather than later), but due to the fact that I'm disabled and that a lot of E.D units aren't wheelchair accessible etc, I will be having to go further from home compared to an able bodied person who doesn't need accessible facilities etc.
I just feel alone - it's lonely enough dealing with anorexia, let alone being disabled as well.

Holiday preoccupations,"Hello
I‚Äôm not sure what my ed could be classified as: it started as diet and exercise now it‚Äôs skipping meals, avoiding food, binging and vomiting, sometimes I chew food and spit it out.
I already had episodes in the past and I now how bad it can get. It‚Äôs been pretty recent that it came back so strong and I have dysmorphia so that adds to the struggle.
I don‚Äôt really want to stop right now.

My question is:
I have to leave for a holiday in a week with a bunch of people (some friends and other I‚Äôm not that close to), we are a group of 10.
How do I handle all my habits (like not having lunch). And I‚Äôm worried they will cook fat foods so I will be eating two bites and making excuses?
I‚Äôm not sure.
And maybe they will see right throw me and start judging or making comments or lectures.
I might have to be a great faker and make people not realize this will actually be a struggle for me.

I already know I won‚Äôt be enjoying myself because I will be focusing on food all the time.
I don‚Äôt really now what I am asking here. Probably a lot of people had it bad and had a rough recovery but maybe some are in this situation I am in or can remember how it feels like.

Looking for people‚Äôs perspectives on my recovery/ED support therapist,"I‚Äôve recently started seeing a therapist for my ED but I‚Äôm not quite sure if we‚Äôre on the same page tbh. I‚Äôve been through many attempts at recovering from my ED or even just reducing my amount of restriction to a point where I can kinda get ‚Äústable‚Äù and eat enough to sustain myself without feeling like I‚Äôm spiralling all day every day, for 11 years. I‚Äôve been restricting for 14 years (over half my life). I‚Äôve had periods where I‚Äôve been more stable but the past year & a half it keeps getting increasingly worse so I need professional support.

I‚Äôve recently decided that I want to try to make some changes to my behaviour, idk if full recovery is in the cards for me but that‚Äôs a future me-problem to figure out. I‚Äôve found an *AMAZING* ED specialist dietitian and I feel like we are completely on the same page and she‚Äôs really working with me starting from harm reduction and making small changes very slowly. I get really triggered by anyone discussing me ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù or ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù/‚Äúbeing in recovery‚Äù so this has been so so so helpful to take a step back and do this at my own pace.

I have been in therapy for 12 years. I know what works for me and what doesn‚Äôt. I was honest with this therapist 2 sessions ago that CBT really doesn‚Äôt work for me but it seems like she hasn‚Äôt really been able to shut that off. I knew that she primarily worked from a CBT lens but I was hoping that since she asked what kind of therapy style works for me and I told her that CBT doesn‚Äôt do anything for me, she would respect that. But she‚Äôs really been pushing me to try changing my thoughts and having me assess my thoughts. I assess my thoughts 24/7, I rationalize the fuck out of my life, I don‚Äôt need to analyze or focus on trying to change them to something ‚Äúless distorted‚Äù or however you want to put it. But she still is hinting at using a CBT type approach or is at least just not on the same page as me. And she says she works a lot with EDs but I‚Äôm getting the sense that mine is more ingrained/entrenched/chronic than she is used to or not really understanding that I‚Äôm not at a ‚ÄúI WANT TO RECOVERY RN IM ALL IN‚Äù place rn. I‚Äôm also just not in a place where I‚Äôm ready to fully attack my thoughts and make it so I‚Äôm quickly able to get more comfortable and ready for recovery and I think that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs used to/her approach to getting people ‚Äúinto recovery.‚Äù 

I have tried bringing this stuff up but she kinda latches onto a thought I share rather than letting me expand on what I wanted talk about. 

I‚Äôm scared to find someone new esp bc I have limited financial resources = limited experienced options but I think I‚Äôm just ending the session being frustrated. So I guess I‚Äôm looking for others‚Äô perspectives on this and whether or not it might be worth moving on.",15m1rjl,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15m1rjl/looking_for_peoples_perspectives_on_my_recoveryed/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-09 02:05:26
I‚Äôm just drinking coffee at this point?,"             *tw, everything*

Im sure I don‚Äôt get hungry anymore at all, nor am I upset about it in the slightest. I drink a few coffees with plenty of heavy dairy and additions/sweeteners a day, and zero actual solid food. It has been this way for weeks now, and I genuinely cannot begin to eat food. The attention I would take from looks from people on the sidewalk feels irrelevant and shameful. I have no clue how to start, I have significant issues with subscribing to many of the published methods of eating disorder recovery, due to my case‚Äôs complications and additions. I too am a bulimic, so if any food actually gets consumed, I am *getting rid* of it, immediately. I am unsure how long I can actually avoid organ failure at this point. I am in near-zero position to even consider recovery, I am into my mid twenties and am facing the consequences of living like this for 6+ years. My teeth are rotting, I look pale and ghostly, it‚Äôs not attractive, in any capacity. Unsure of the ending of this tangent, just felt that I should speak that. I like many, and many before me, am facing the sharp end of the knife we play with for so many years.

And on yet another hand, my life is basically over, I'm unable to pursue my dreams in life and I'm kinda stuck, living in the middle of nowhere with no friends or real connections, with my only hope being that I can move with the help of the social system... eventually

So back when I was 16-17 I was in my peak honeymoon phase. Which is bad for many reasons but one of them was me not noticing a friend of mine (Who I will call R) is actually jealous of me for a long list of reasons. The starting one being a boy they liked asking them if I was single.

Little did I know R started copying my eating habits. I would notice them staring at me while I eat but that was common given it was well know by my friends at that point about my ed. While this made me wildly uncomfortable I would always brush it off because I thought they were just worried. Later on we dont talk anymore do to other reasons.

Now today, 3-4 years later. Im finding out that I am the direct cause of their eating disorder from a mutual friend of ours. I feel immense guilt and shame.

How to seek help?,"
Hi, so this has taken a lot to write.. I‚Äôm always lurking on these subs feeling like I relate so much to the symptoms of anorexia. 
I am 23 don‚Äôt think technically I am underweight, but not far off. I gave birth to my son 9 months ago and what started off as a ‚Äúweight loss journey‚Äù has quickly became something I don‚Äôt feel in control of. 

I read stories on here from people who are anorexic and weigh a lot less than me. And even though I relate to their symptoms, I don‚Äôt want to seek help and waste anybody‚Äôs time when I‚Äôm nowhere near that small. 

I lie to my family about what I‚Äôve eaten, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already eaten‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sooo full‚Äù even if my stomach is grumbling. 

I count calories for everything. And always make sure it‚Äôs below a certain number, I even Googled how many calories are in toothpaste, and got scared to take my daily vitamins because it didn‚Äôt state if there was any calories in them. 

I find myself staring at myself in the mirror every day just pinching bits of me I want to disappear, and when I see my ribs sticking out a bit more, or my spine, I feel like I‚Äôve accomplished something and it fuels me to keep going. 

My family have expressed concerns about how small I‚Äôm getting, but all I say is ‚Äú I have a baby I run around 24/7 and that‚Äôs why the weight is coming off ‚Äú I feel awful for using my child as a way to explain this away to people üò£ 

When I do eat it‚Äôs extremely controlled, if someone gave me rice or pasta I would probably break down in tears because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to eat it, I substitute carbs for cauliflower rice. And tell my partner because it‚Äôs ‚Äòhealthier‚Äô. I‚Äôll have this with a side of chicken, no sauce, I refuse to cook using oil because of the calories. 

I watch programmes like supersize vs super skinny just to get tips from the underweight people and implement this into my daily life

Food,"Am I weird for getting take out as my only meal when I do have a meal? Like I usually only have 1 official meal in a day if I do have a meal.

Anyone else do this? 

I dk what my problem is (maybe I'm lazy) but like I have no desire to cook or make anything for myself if I do eat.

Note: when I do get something it could be anything from a salad to anything else. Not a binge (I don't do that). Just a meal. I don't always eat the whole thing. Today I did. I was proud of myself (kinda) and upset at myself).

My biggest thing like obsession lately as well has been smoothies (which for me is part of take out). Like Tropical Cafe smoothies. I discovered them more when I was at the eating disorder unit. And ever since then I get the same one as I did that day the RSS's took me there for a challenge. (RSS = Residential Supportive Staff).

Advice please,"Mentions of food intake below, no calories etc mentioned. Mentions of purging after eating / drinking. 

I‚Äôm asking here because I‚Äôm really worried and I really don‚Äôt have anyone I can ask about this; I‚Äôm currently having my best friend live with me who has Anorexia with bulimic tendencies. I used to suffer from binge eating disorder in my early 20s and I‚Äôve been helping her through her trying to improve her eating habits 

For the past 3 months she has been eating a semi regular diet with me, at least lunch and an evening meal with a tea before bed. Before she came to stay with me she was in a complete starvation period where she would just purge and take laxative, over exercise (running with heart palpitations) and have nausea and dizziness every day. I took her to see a therapist but she didn‚Äôt really engage with it; I had seen a therapist for my issues and this was helpful to me in terms of someone listening to me. We were going out and doing things, hiking, movies, meals out, beach days etc etc‚Ä¶ I know that it‚Äôs complicated and has ups and downs but she was talking to me whenever she purged or was struggling. 

But the past week has been completely different. At first it was eating then purging within 2 hours (for the past 6 days) but now it‚Äôs not drinking either. The advice that I‚Äôm wanting is about the fluids‚Ä¶ because I don‚Äôt have any experience with this and I‚Äôm desperate to hear from other people. She didn‚Äôt drink all day yesterday and drank one glass of water today and purged it after one hour. I‚Äôm really worried about whether she can survive without water??

Giving up on recovery,"TW TW TW SEXUAL ASSUALT MENTIONED

So i need to vent because im getting angry and upset the more i think about it. 

I have anorexia binge purge type. I am severely underweight as in i should be on bedrest etc. I have tried to recover several times till i reached a healthy weight. 

My eating disorder is based on a trauma, ive been sexual abused several times, this is the reason why i fear a healthy body because i am affraid to get touched. The body i have now makes me feel safe because i dont look ""attractive"". 

So i am upset because ive been in group treatment and so far every of my groupmates are doing really well in recovery, as they say: i want my breasts and bootie back"" but they notice im not doing well in recovery and they are trying to push me, knowing i fear the female roundings because it triggers my trauma enormously. 

Anyway it annoys me a lot to hear every time how wonderful recovery is. Because thats bullshit for people who use the ED to erease the female bodyparts. To me gaining weight means im losing my shield which protects me from unwanted touches. This is why i dont want to recover, and yes i know the consequences of anorexia.. but i cant handle another sexual assault.",15kt37d,8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15kt37d/giving_up_on_recovery/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-07 18:39:09

Inpatient admissions at a healthy weight,"Basically the title. I've been struggling with my ED for almost 5 years now, starting when I was 13, and I'm turning 18 soon. I had an obese start weight, so even though I lost a considerate amount of weight and my body is really sick, I'm still in a healthy BMI. My parents, therapist and dietician are really pushing for inpatient treatment, and that search is going to start incredibly soon. I'm just terrified. Will I even be accepted if I'm a healthy weight? Will I be forced to gain back to my starting weight? I don't know what to expect and I'm genuinely terrified.

 I want to get better and we tried for two years to see if I could recover at home and on my own, but I only meet with my dietician and therapist weekly virtually. It just isn't enough. I want my life back. I don't want to isolate and weigh myself multiple times a day because I'm scared of letting it go for too long un-checked. I miss my friends and my family but I'm too sick and have been missing out on so much because of it. I just don't want to be a waste of valuable resources for someone else because I'm not sick enough yet.

I had gone from an almost healthy weight to sitting on the edge of being underweight in a matter of a month maybe. I wasn‚Äôt in a high healthy BMI range at the start of my first relapse mentioned. So it wasn‚Äôt hard to drop the weight and border the underweight BMI start range.

And I was experiencing a lot of anxiety, thinking ""omg I'm gonna die"". But like I said, I don't want to recover right now. So I'm gonna go back to restricting tomorrow. 

I know the health consequences of anorexia because I've researched it and I've been to the ER for it. Not recently. It was years ago.

Birth control,"So, a while ago I started to recover from anorexia on my own and it has been a rollercoaster. As a still maturing female I lost my period for quite some time and am trying to get it back.I started birth control a month ago in an attempt to regulate my period and give my body the hormones it needs to do it's thing. It is currently the time of the month that I am taking the placebo pills but I still haven't gotten my period. I am thinking of talking to my doctor about uping my dose of hormones but I don't know if that would do anything to help. I have been seriously stressing that I messed my body up so much that I can't have a period anymore.

I don‚Äôt feel valid,"Idk how to make myself want to get better.

I have no facts to back that up and I know it‚Äôs the ED talking. And I know EDs show up differently for everyone, but I‚Äôm having a really hard time with the fact that I‚Äôm not externally having as hard a time as some others in the group (during meal times for example).

A poem about Anorexia,"So I‚Äôm hoping you guys will appreciate this poem. I write poetry a lot and I find it really healing so I thought I would share one I recently wrote. I‚Äôve been trying to recover from this ed for awhile now so if anyone is where I‚Äôm at in this journey also, I hope this helps. 

(title) Enemy number one: Food 

She comes into your life disguised as a friend, 
Promises of self love and worth and comfort and 
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just pretend.‚Äù 
She says, 
as she creeps into the cracks and
feasts on your soul 
Let‚Äôs you nibble on the illusion
Lets you think you have control
She decorates your skin with the sharp edges of your bones, 
Says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going into battle. Let‚Äôs carve your gravestone.‚Äù 
Anorexia is a glutton, haven‚Äôt you heard the stories?
She gorges herself on the meat from our bodies
Makes pretty desserts from the thoughts in our heads
Says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll be fine. You‚Äôll feel better when you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù 
Anorexia is a con artist, don‚Äôt you see it dear? 
She lured us in with peaceful whispers in our ears
Starved us and sized us, for the smallest coffin possible 
Said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, don‚Äôt panic. You‚Äôll be alright. I‚Äôm right here.‚Äù 
I‚Äôve asked for help you know. 
If you would‚Äôve listened closely,
‚ÄúNo thank you.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm stuffed.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll eat later‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hungry.‚Äù",15iaw9w,17,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15iaw9w/a_poem_about_anorexia/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-08-04 20:28:21

Losing my mind :(,"Even if I wasn‚Äôt struggling with an Ed I‚Äôd be extremely stressed rn bc school and some social things but it‚Äôs like with the Ed I‚Äôm just empty like I‚Äôll be at my internship or trying to do hw and I can‚Äôt force myself to work/use my brain anymore like all I can do is blankly stare and I‚Äôm so physically uncomfortable all the time and none of my clothes fit at all but I‚Äôm too broke to buy new ones but I need professional clothes for my internship 

But like at this point I can‚Äôt stop :/ I‚Äôll have moments of clarity where I‚Äôm like ok I don‚Äôt wanna live like this I want to feel good physically and then I‚Äôll have distortions abt my body or the ‚Äúgood‚Äù things it has brought me (these r usually lies I tell myself to justify) and I kinda just don‚Äôt wanna eat normal anymore it doesn‚Äôt seem possible 

And it‚Äôs like so I started this relapse at an obese bmi and I keep running into ppl who last saw me at the weight and it‚Äôs so embarrassing bc they are so surprised now and then like omg wow u look amazing how did u do that!?!!! And it‚Äôs like :/// damn so I was ugly I mean like it‚Äôs embarrassing to know I was perceived that way for so long and I‚Äôm sure I still am it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt wanna be perceived I just wanna sleep all day I have no energy but I have so many responsibilities and then also I don‚Äôt wanna give ppl unrealistic expectations abt weight loss but I‚Äôm not abt to be like ya I have a Ed bc that‚Äôs not good for those convos I feel like not only am I hurting myself I‚Äôm hurting everyone around me too but I can‚Äôt!!!

exercise tips?,"For context, I used to have an exercise addiction. I would cry and get super stressed and upset if I didn‚Äôt get the right amount of steps in, missed my workout etc etc‚Ä¶ when i started recovery, i was at the point where i was too weak to even get into the gym anymore. the doctors told me not to exercise. When I was evaluated for an out patient program, they told me I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to go on short walks. 
So i haven‚Äôt done much exercise since april (when i started recovery) i‚Äôve just been eating and trying to feel better, which I do, but now i miss movement. like A LOT, but i‚Äôm worried that it will just trigger my ed or something. i need it to be positive bc exercise used to be a way for me to release stress. I‚Äôm also nervous about starting up activity after a long pause because it‚Äôs very daunting. 
so here‚Äôs my question: how do i know i‚Äôm ready to go back? 
and what exercises/workouts do you recommend? my mom wants to start lifting and not doing cardio anymore (which is what i used to do). i have fitness goals do build/define my core and glutes. any tips? what should i eat/how much/when should i eat before the gym? 
i was also wondering if anyone had any tips for exhaustion/feel exhausted constantly during recovery if i am just tired. lol.

how do i deal with people on keto,"i (24F) am going on vacation in 3 months with my fianc√©e‚Äôs family. my future sister in law (30F?) will be coming as well and she is on the keto diet. as far as i know, she has been on keto for years and every single time i‚Äôm around her it enters the conversation somehow or she has to mention that she can‚Äôt eat xyz. she told me awhile ago that she used to be anorexic and now keto has helped her recover, but i‚Äôm not buying it. the amount of restrictions she puts on herself is extremely triggering to me and it‚Äôs exhausting. she is still anorexic, but she‚Äôs just calling it something else now tbh. last time we went on vacation together i was struggling a lot and being around her during meals was so so tiring. i can now say that i am mostly recovered and i feel great, but i‚Äôm terrified of this trip. i love her and she is great to hang out with but it‚Äôs so hard to avoid talking about her stupid diet and comparing what i eat to her. anyone have any tips on how to prepare for this? it‚Äôs a beach trip as well so we will be in swimsuits often of course üôÑ

My mind says only organ failure/permanent damage can validate anorexia but I don't want to die (I think),"I really hope I can be honest. I'm so scared I've fucked up my digestive system and other organs. I've been getting really concerning symptoms. But at the same time it's so fucked up cos if I'm not honest and everything is fine then I'll just use that to reinforce the notion that  I'm invincible and can cope with it. 

Whats's more is the last time my organs were failing I was sectioned soon after (I'm from the UK) 
 And being sectioned is something I'd never ever want to go through again.

What do I do?,"Hi I don‚Äôt really know how to start this but I‚Äôm gonna go for it, also please don‚Äôt read this if you think you will be triggered! 
So I‚Äôve had ARFID all my life but I‚Äôve been experiencing bad anorexia for the last 2 years ish? I was very overweight and lost that weight to the point where my therapist now says I‚Äôm underweight but only slightly. I went into treatment for my ED in January I think? But because of my ARFID it make it hard to eat anyway. 
Anyway, the main point, I have been passing out since last November and it‚Äôs not too often but maybe like once or twice a month. I think it‚Äôs due to low blood sugar but I‚Äôm not sure? I can feel my body start to shut down and it gets really hard to breathe. Everything goes blurry and I can only do or think one thing at a time. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it very well but all the things your body does on it‚Äôs own like breathing and that just becomes manual. I have to force myself to breathe and it feels like I don‚Äôt know how to. I also can‚Äôt talk or move it just feels like my brain and body are separate and everything is slow. I am usual conscious whilst this happens but I can‚Äôt move or see much and it just gets worse till I pass out completely which luckily hasn‚Äôt happened much. It‚Äôs is honestly terrifying and I genuinely think I‚Äôm gonna die every time it happens. I used to come out of these episodes in shock and scream and cry but I think I‚Äôm used to it now and can hold it in. Now you probably think why don‚Äôt you just eat? I do that‚Äôs the problem. It started when I didn‚Äôt eat which was understandable but now I do eat and it‚Äôs still happening. I‚Äôm worried that if I pass out again I won‚Äôt wake up and have asked the ambulance to be called just before I pass out whilst I can still talk. But, I live with my parents still, my mum doesn‚Äôt want too she says they will keep me in hospital which I‚Äôd be ok with if this stopped. But she said they will also take my driving licence, I can drive ok and these episodes are something I feel coming so I wouldn‚Äôt drive if I felt bad. I‚Äôve seen diabetics carry juice with them so I do that too now just in case. College is the only reason my other mental health problems haves took me out yet and I need my licence to get there. But this passing out stuff if so scary and I can‚Äôt do anything but sit inside my own body when it happens. I hate it and I want it to stop but I don‚Äôt know what to do. The doctors did my bloods and ecg back in January and other that being anaemic I was ok. So I don‚Äôt know if I actually need any help all I know is that I don‚Äôt usually get scared if this stuff but the feeling of not waking up is not feeling very fun right now. Especially when my mum is right there and I can‚Äôt even tell her I love her.

How do I do it?,"I've had issues with food pretty much my whole life, earliest I can remember is elementary school. It kicked up around covid, I binged quite a bit, and hardly ate any real meals. When I went back to school in person, I got really insecure, and I had some disordered eating behaviors. However, what really triggered it was when I started going to a new school, I had a group of friends, 2 of which were very blatantly pro ana. I downloaded tracking and fasting apps, I repeated those dumbass proana bullshit slogans like a mantra. I kind of drifted away from it after a while, but I fell back into it. I would ""forget"" to eat all day, and only eat dinner. sometimes I wouldn't even do that. And now, I've conditioned myself so much that I can hardly ever finish a meal. I've noticed more hair than usual coming out in the shower and when I brush, and I'm almost certain it feels thinner. I've been trying to eat more nutritious and full meals, but when I get to a certain point, it becomes hard to chew and swallow, I go from enjoying it, to just going through the motions and forcing it down. I hate the empty feeling I get when my body is screaming at me to give it food, and when I try, it's like my brain does anything it can to stop me. It also doesn't help that I have adhd and take meds, because no matter what, there is not 1 adhd medication that doesn't cause appetite suppression. I just want to be normal.

How to start recovery,"Hi, I have never really done this before so please bear with me. My anorexia started in 2017, when I was 16. I was dating someone that completely destroyed me mentally. He would say horrible things about my body to others in front of me for one small example. I‚Äôve never been overweight. I was with him for three years before getting into another poor relationship (I‚Äôm the kind of person that attaches to others very easily if I‚Äôm given any form of attention due to childhood neglect) and that worsened it for me. Now, I‚Äôm in a healthy relationship with a different man, and I was doing really well for the first few months and I‚Äôve been declining ever since. During the first boyfriend, I ended up losing quite a bit of weight in two months. Right now I‚Äôm at my lowest and I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôve never been that low before and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm living paycheck to paycheck, so a therapy bill is out of my range, but I have gone before. Right now I can‚Äôt eat more than maybe a cup sized of food a day without feeling sick. People are constantly telling me to eat more, but I physically can‚Äôt. Calories never bothered me, I‚Äôm not worried about that. I just can‚Äôt eat no matter how hard I try. What are some ways that helps? I know I can eat calorie dense food, but then again, I can only eat so much without feeling the need to throw up. I don‚Äôt make myself throw up either, it‚Äôs just the feeling that if I eat any more, my stomach will burst and I get really sick. Can I have any tips? Please? My hip bones are jutting out, I‚Äôm losing hair, and my knees are starting to poke out too.

Just a little story time and encouragement for you to get out of a negative environment if you can.,"So when I first moved to a new state, i worked at a coffee shop and being the very very social person I am I immediately started talking to everyone. To my surprise, all of my coworkers were younger girls and waaaay more serious and blunt than I could ever be. I'm very loud and very talkative and I annoyed the living hell out of everyone, but at first I didn't care because I'll always be myself and not apologize for it. I love my humor and I love my empathy and if someone doesn't, that's okay! It started to get really vicious and I walked past each of them talking about me several times. It got to the point where even my body was talked about. I heard two shift supervisors saying 'god, for someone so skinny she's always in the way' and 'does she ever shut up? Let's just keep her on window the whole shift so she can annoy them not us' 

This was during my worst relapse and these words truly sent me spiriling because I was actually hearing the words I would say to myself, out loud. My mental illness because reality and I kinda of... Didn't want to be around anymore. 
I started restricting harder which caused my brain fog to be at hazardless levels. Like if it were the weather, there'd be a do not drive advisory. 

My coworkers then started calling me dumb, too slow to do anything and 'I don't even know what position to out you in because you can't do anything. It's like you are just coming to earth for the first time'

Everything they said cut like a knife. 
I worked there for a year before realizing I was going to die physically as well as mentally if I did not leave. 

Once I quit I still struggled immensely and their words still played in my head like a broken record. But it wasn't long until those voices quited. My brain gave up playing the same song on repeat because it played so much I stopped caring. It's been about 3 months and I've already started weight restoring and being more active and present. 

So. If this story resonates with you and you're in a toxic environment. Please leave if possible. It will only drive the ED faster than before.

Comments,"So when I see my mom shes telling me how I'm scaring her with how I look.
I have anorexia nervosa. Diagnosed.
I'm in relapse since last month when she mentioned how she assumes i eat.
Last year I was very tiny i got treatment. And in treatment I overshoot my original weight. This is the biggest I've been in my life. Some people have told me I'm at the worst part of recovery.
Well now I'm I relapse. But while my doctor who's her doctor as well, is telling me not to worry and getting me the help I need, she's scares for me based on diet culture.
I'm already barely eating. Some days I don't even have a meal. Some days it's skipping meals. Some days it's grazing. But to outsiders and sadly even my own mother, it looks like I'm binging when I'm doing the opposite. It makes it hard to want to recover. She doesn't understand that too much exercise can be a form of purging. My doctor only allows me 20 min of walking a day. Add to that the walking I do because I'm a mom of 4. So I am not stationary all day long. I feel like I just can't get her to understand. What she is saying is triggering me. Just venting.

Dose it ever stop?,"I've battled anorexia Since I can remember, no matter how much I weigh, I've always been called fat. I began my recovery last year when I joined a rehabilitation programme and began attending group therapy. I joined because I was constantly ill, had trouble sleeping, and couldn't even afford to eat.

Nobody knows about my anorexia, at least I‚Äôve never admitted to anyone about it. My weight never got bad enough for anyone to notice. At one time, my mother had a suspicion, but I simply denied it, and she went on. Even my therapist is unaware. Maybe it's just my toxic masculinity, but I figured I could handle it on my own.

my significant other keeps an eye on my diet, always worries if I‚Äôm eating enough. He‚Äôs into feeding fetishes but he wouldn‚Äôt force me to over eat or nothing like that but he does give me a significant amount of attention if I do over eat so naturally I started binge eating without noticing, until recently. I keep sweating, I‚Äôm out of breath and In generally just feel gross. I also started HRT (hormone replacement therapy) which made me gain even more weight. Now I‚Äôve gained over 30kg, it makes me feel awful, most of my favourite clothes don‚Äôt fit me anymore. 

I try to work out 3 times a week but I just can‚Äôt stop eating junk food. If I have a bad day or a stressful day I result to take out immediately. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I want this to stop. it got me thinking about anorexia in general. Last night my sister showed me old videos of myself when I was balls deep into anorexia and I was so so little but I remember thinking that I was so big. I always feel big. No matter what. Does it ever stop? 

I give up on diets because of this, then I end up regretting it immediately. My family also keeps pointing out my weight gain, they always say it‚Äôs in a good way but I don‚Äôt hear it in a good way. It makes me feel even worse.

I feel so embarrassed. I‚Äôve even began thinking about going back to starving myself again but it‚Äôs literally not possible for me anymore.

How do I support a romantic partner who recently opened up about their Anorexia,"Hey friends, my S.O. opened up about their recent and significant struggles with anorexia. I went home and researched E.D. and how to be supportive and helpful while the road to recovery is being paved, but I'm hoping to hear some insight from the community. 

I've come to learn that generally speaking I can't necessarily ""help"" with the E.D. but I want to be as supportive and understanding as I can so they feel comfortable talking to me about it. I recently learned a good bit but I feel like the broad strokes I've learned aren't necessarily as helpful in the moment. 

For example: in the past if they said they were having a bad body image day, I would respond with assurance they are beautiful or something along those lines because I didn't really understand what they meant and the harm those sentiments have in that moment. Although that's just one example, I hope it is kind of a launching point for a discussion on how to be the support system someone needs as they navigate the difficult situation.

New to this,"I have just recently realized I have true anorexia nervosa and not physically induced anorexia. I had cancer 3 years ago that made me gain a ton of weight a long with a double mastectomy that came with it‚Äôs own body image issues. I subconsciously stopped eating about 18 months ago. I didn‚Äôt notice any results and so it became more severe as time progressed. I had to get a blood transfusion last fall and have to use a shower chair now as I faint in the shower if I stand. I really didn‚Äôt see any weight fluctuations for the first year of not eating but I have lost 25% of my body weight in the past 6 months. I‚Äôve just recently accepted this is AN and started going to therapy but I feel like I have more work that needs done than an hour per week can provide. I also don‚Äôt know how severe of symptoms require inpatient work versus outpatient. My state has no inpatient centers so I would either have to do virtual or fully commit and travel out of state. I am honestly just terrified to start the recovery process as I don‚Äôt want to gain weight. I was strictly getting intake from energy drinks and no solid foods, and now can eat a little solids but not much. Eating also makes me nauseous now so it‚Äôs hard to keep food down even if I mentally allow myself to eat.

Australia's public health system is terrible,"TW: physical violence

Need to vent on behalf of my sister with an ed. She is in a public hospital currently, and they treat her so awfully. She is already traumatised by the public health system. The nurses and doctors have ignored my sister's pleas for help, as she hasn't been able to excrete or urinate in two days. Instead of listening to her, the medical staff have yelled at her, blamed her ed for her pains, had security men manhandle her, PULL DOWN HER PANTS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WARD, and sedated her. I feel so awful that this is how ed's are being treated in Australia. I am disgusted, and angry as hell.

I truly feel for each and every one of you.

Too scared to eat enough to maintain weight. Help,"Hello. I was in recovery for 2 years, but recently lost a lot of weight.  Most of it was unintentional, but it triggered a relapse and now I'm super scared to eat enough again. 

I need to stop losing weight because my older brother (who I live with) keeps telling me he's going to send me back to the mental hospital if I keep losing weight. He wants me to gain weight. 

I don't want to gain. That terrifies me. I just want to maintain my current weight to hopefully stay out of the hospital, but I have no idea how... I've been trying to eat enough to maintain, but I keep failing. So my weight is continuing to go down... 

I'm just terrified I'll accidentally eat too many calories and gain weight. And I can't seem to bring myself to eat over a certain amount of calories, even though I know my weight will continue to go down on that amount.

Food is giving me a lot of anxiety right now. I'm just terrified of gaining weight and looking fat. And I just got to this weight. I'm underweight again and I don't want to gain weight right now. I don't even look underweight. Logically, I know I look skinny. But not underweight skinny. I love looking skinny and I think I look prettier at this weight. It's super tempting for me to lose even more weight. 

My brother doesn't know I'm underweight. I've been lying to him about how much I weigh. If he knew, he would send me to the hospital. He does sometimes force me on the scale so he can see for himself how much I weigh, but I have a plan to trick the scale for next time he does it.

I don't know what to ask. I guess I just want advice on how to maintain so I don't get sent to the hospital.

Thanks

I was in the Pro-Anorexia community for 7 years from age 12 - Ask me anything,"The topic of conversation came up with a friend recently and I thought I would post. 

- I never encouraged anyone towards anything but anorexia recovery

- I was in recovery for 5 years and have maintained a healthy weight for 4 years, I am now 24 years old and still struggle every day

- I was diagnosed with anorexia at 15 after being underweight for 3 

- I accessed pro ana via tumblr

Nausea in early ana recovery,"Hello, I am 1 month into my anorexia recovery. I just have reintroduced eating meals the last month and everything has been pretty smooth on the physical side of things. Until yesterday morning after breakfast I got hit with extreme nausea and loss of appetite that lasted about an hour. It went away for the most part and I tried snacking on just some fruit, yet again was hit with extreme nausea. And then again when I tried eating later last night. I hoped I just had a bad day considering I‚Äôve been in a depressive episode with loads of anxiety. But then today, about 15 minutes after breakfast I got hit with that same nausea but this time more severe. This is really discouraging and really really triggering :/ I just started building trust again for food and this is making me think it‚Äôs gonna lead to a relapse.

Another genuine question,"So, i am young, very to say the least, im on here because i am struggling with an ed, and have been for the past 1 year. However, i have improved so much, i freely eat and don‚Äôt purge after any meals, though still have times i restrict a tiny bit. 

My problem is, after i eat, i genuinely get scared on how fat i will look after. Like, my sister can eat an entire dinner and look the same, but she has the same kind of body shape as me (belly wise) and its so confusing?? 
 
Lets say i have a full glass of water, im bloated for the next 3 hours, feel sick, and have water coming up if i lie down and don‚Äôt want to eat because i feel nauseous. 

Is it medical?? or do i just have a slow metabolism? also any tips on how to bloat less??",15elnfb,3,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15elnfb/another_genuine_question/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-31 17:00:11
I'm really stressed...,"I went on this vacation with my family to a different country, we're leaving for home in a couple days

And yeah, I let myself eat basically whatever, in the span of those two weeks I probably ate more calories than I have the entire rest of the year combined

And I'm... kinda freaking out, I'm gonna gain so much weight, it'll absolutely obliterate me mentally, I mean I know I can just lose it again but that's not the point, I'm gonna seriously struggle for potentially months after we're back, and I'm really not sure how to cope, I'm already kinda freaking out and I don't even know how much I weigh yet

I used to open up to them about my struggles but as soon as they told me it was too much for them to handle I stopped.

i never used to be socially awkward,"now after a real dumpster-fire of a couple of years, i've lost a part of me, i'm certain of it. I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted, on top of the fatigue i get from not eating or from purging. It was my bday and my grandma jokingly asked me if I felt any older, and i replied with a monotone ""yea, i do feel older"" and then changed the subject because i feel like life is passing me by. A neighbour gave me a gift of chocolate for my bday and jokingly said ""looks like you could use the calories!"" and i just said ""yea..."" and then excused myself and went to my room. I just care less and less about how i behave around others now, if i reply to a text or not, so much of my life now is just escape and calories, tuning out, over exercising, restricting, bingeing, purging, isolating. I just give less and less fucks and there are less and less days where i feel like getting better. Nothing i do seems to matter. I've had severe fear of failure for my whole life and the past couple of years have burned out and now i have fear of success as well, that if i rise up and am successful again, i'll just fail and fall that much harder, in everything, job, health, relationship, etc, etc,, etc. Everyone is doing a better job than me or learning from their mistakes better than me.

My ED is like my closest friend, always there, one thing that's in my control, and that's mine. And there's a voice saying this friend will clearly betray you, but more and more it's like i'm just watching from outside my body as i continue to just do this shit anyways. If you've read this, thank you, i have nowhere else to vent this, i don't belong anywhere, i can't tell my therapist although i don't think he buys all my excuses for my weight loss... my situation feels like I'm a mouse on a treadmill with a furnace behind me and plexiglass in front of me, with a life worth living on the other side.

Had some random stranger call me fat on the street,"Basically title. After a long long day of my partner gently encouraging me to each something all day I finally caved and let myself order some food from a nearby restaurant that sells food I feel safe eating. I was even going to get myself some ice cream from an ice cream food truck that usually parks right by the restaurant as a treat for overcoming my negative thoughts. The walk from my apartment is maximum 3 minutes, it‚Äôs literally two blocks away. At the first light, my partner and I notice someone across the street who is clearly having some sort of episode, they were talking to themselves and yelled at a passing car. We‚Äôre not looking in her direction and were prepared to just cross the street and move on. I don‚Äôt know what I did to encourage her attention, but for some reason she locked onto me and was making fun of the way I was leaning to wait for the green light to walk. She starts walking past us and starts immediately yelling at me. She immediately goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fucking ** pounds bitch! You‚Äôre a hell of a lot more than that‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see a woman here I see two men and one of them is ugly as hell‚Äù, among many other things. She kept making fun of my weight and calling me ugly. One of the cars driving past us honks and rolls down his window and encourages her by saying ‚ÄúYeah babe you tell her!!‚Äù. Then, when she was close enough, she tried to spit on me. As she was walking closer to me and was just about to pass us both, she says ‚Äúwhat the fuck does your fucking shirt say anyway‚Äù. I was wearing this dumb old pajama shirt that has the name of one of the gyms that I used to go to that says ‚Äúfit for life‚Äù on it along with the name of the gym. As she‚Äôs walking past she snickers and scoffs and goes ‚Äúwell THAT‚ÄôS a fucking lie‚Äù. Something about this shirt triggered her enough that she decided to make a U-Turn and follow us and continues shaking me and my body and calling me ugly. We didn‚Äôt notice she was following us until another car stopped at a red light trying to turn right rolled down his window to warn us. That‚Äôs when I turned around and looked right at her and turned around again. I didn‚Äôt say anything, but suddenly she just stopped and just started walking in the other direction. 

I‚Äôm just really hurt. I‚Äôve been on a road to letting myself eat more and more and I know that it is making me gain weight. I‚Äôve been having a hard time accepting that clothes that used to be baggy on me fit and are even a bit tight now. It‚Äôs been a hard mental battle and everyone around me has been encouraging me that I don‚Äôt look overweight, and that is was just real weight I needed to gain for my health. I just feel discouraged because in my mind, clearly that‚Äôs not true if this random stranger‚Äôs first thought upon seeing me is to comment on my weight. I‚Äôve spent the rest of the day letting my meal rest in the fridge just mentally battling my toxic thoughts again. 

I‚Äôm tired of not feeling safe eating food anymore. When it‚Äôs not my brain berating me, it‚Äôs a random stranger on the street.",15e4ic8,80,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15e4ic8/had_some_random_stranger_call_me_fat_on_the_street/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-31 03:06:51

Ugh.,"About 3 weeks ago I had a heart attack in front of my closest friend. It lasted a while. The paramedics thought I was about to die at any moment. Well, after I completed a mental health assessment and discharged myself AMA, I left. For the last 5 weeks I've been purging and taking a lot of laxatives. I average 50 a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It has reached that point where I cannot go up a flight of stairs without gasping for breath, without my legs feeling like they're on fire. I'm seeing my GP on Thursday. I'm going to be as honest as I can about all the physical symptoms I'm experiencing despite extreme reservations. Contrary to my actions, I don't want to die, and I want to construct a future but the more I think about it the more anxious I become and the behaviours become worse. 

Last year I was sectioned (for the upteenth time) because of this. And yet, even though it was really bad then, this is the worst I've ever felt. I want to stop this so bad but I also want a life I feel safe living in. Anorexia is that safety net. But it's killing me.

Let's Spread Some Positivity! Community Event #1,"Hi everyone! As you can guess from the title, the purpose of this post is to try and bind us together more as a community by spreading motivation and positvity. I will try to do these somewhat commonly, perhaps once or twice a week. Later, I'll get on my computer and schedule a bunch of them in advance. 

Now, what is this event about? Today, let's share our favourite mental health motivation-related quotes and sayings. You can share them in the form of quotes or images and everything goes, as long as all the subreddit rules are upheld. 

I'll go first:
I know it's clich√©, but I've always loved the ""Rceovery isn't linear"" saying. I also love all of The Latest Kate(Instagram)'s little mental health animal drawings. I think they're adorable and a great, cute way of spreading positivity. 

If you don't know how to share an image in a comment, then you can add it as an imgur link! Just saying quotes/sayings is completely acceptable as well. 

I hope we're able to have some fun with this event! If you have any suggestions for ones in the future, please comment them or modmail them to us. 

Have a fantastic day, everyone!",15dsgw1,16,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15dsgw1,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-30 18:22:41
I have an addiction with writing Eating disorder fanfictions,"Backstory: I‚Äôve been a huge fan of reading fanfic for around four years and I especially like reading angst.

Like two years ago I started writing them and it‚Äôs honestly an addiction, I‚Äôve written them for so many different fandoms and every time I watch a show or movie I start thinking about how the main character would develop an ed.

picky eating as a child?,"since before i can remember, before i had anorexia, i was an extremely picky eater.  sometimes i wonder if the fact that i always had issues with food, started my anorexia. when i was YOUNG (3/4 years old) and forward, i never ate fruits, vegetables, spices, sauces, fish, anything with a mushy or dry texture, colored green and stuff like that. and if i did, i‚Äôd throw up unwillingly. i hated basically anything that wasn‚Äôt chicken nuggets, french fries or certain desserts. at that young age, i obviously didn‚Äôt mean it in the restrictive way, but it was an issue. i was always relatively skinny growing up, even with all the junk i ate (since i wouldn‚Äôt dare eat any healthy food) but, when i hit puberty i guess the body changes and weight gain hit me all at once. my ed was triggered whenever i felt sad, and it was my coping mechanism. a way to feel numb. also, i have ocd, so i guess it was the control that came with it. i just wonder if the picky eating as a child (the arfid and un-willingly throwing up) contributed to my later anorexia.",15ded6z,23,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15ded6z/picky_eating_as_a_child/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-30 06:31:02

forced recovery is triggering my depression,"a few weeks ago i started going to a partial hospitalization program (php) for recovery due to my mom and the medical team's recommendation.

i hate it. i hate every second i spend there. i hate that i'm gaining weight, i hate that my body is getting used to eating this much food, i hate myself. i can't stand to look at myself in the mirror and feel disgusted. i can't put on my nice clothes because i feel way too insecure.

the treatment team there is trying to help me, but honestly it's not doing anything. tbh i don't want to recover. even when i was at my peak of my ed i was physically and mentally doing just fine. so i just don't see the need to recover. i felt way more confident and prettier, so why do i need to recover if that means i'm going to be depressed and be in self-hatred?

i know my depression is getting worse bc i haven't been having enough energy for hygiene and sleep every night for 11 hours or more (these have been red flags for me in the past multiple times). i just don't know what to do. all i want to do is go back to my old weight and feel pretty and happy.",15d9mf4,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15d9mf4/forced_recovery_is_triggering_my_depression/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-30 02:15:24

Has this happened to anyone before? What do I do?," Deleted my crosspost to try posting this fresh instead so maybe more people will read it <3

TLDR-   Is one week of high res enough to throw my body out of wack? I  relapsed for a week and I'm trying to re-up my intake and now I'm  feeling sick. I don't know what to do. I'm coming here to ask for help  because no one else would understand these circumstances.

I've  been doing REALLY well with recovery for a while, but I had a bit of a  lapse and started restricting again for the past 7 days. I've had a  headache and shaky hands nonstop, and the feeling is so addictive. It's  hard to stop this cycle again now that I'm back in it.

My  therapist is helping with harm reduction while I try to pull out of  this lapse. I'm trying not to eat under BMR. But, I'm also not tracking  with an app, just estimating, so I don't actually know how hard I've  been restricting. I just know that I cut my intake by a pretty  significant amount.

I tried eating  closer to my normal amount last night, and had a snack before bed. I  woke up so nauseous today and had to call out of work. Today I have been  trying to keep up with the higher (aka normal) intake and I feel awful.  I'm nauseous, anxious, and feeling really overheated even with an ice  pack on my neck. The symptoms are far from unbearable, I'm just chilling  on the couch, but I definitely don't feel okay.

Has  this happened to anyone else? I know people on reddit are not doctors,  but members of this sub would probably be better-positioned to answer  this question than my GP.

Is there anything I can do for these symptoms?

Any thoughts or advice would be so appreciated. Edited to make the post a little shorter and easier to read.",15ctp5v,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15ctp5v/has_this_happened_to_anyone_before_what_do_i_do/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-29 14:29:52

Men getting upset at the amount you eat?,"Why are men bothered by the amount you eat? 

I am now a recovered anorexic, but my whole life I have always felt awkward eating a lot in front of others/cannot eat a lot in one sitting. 

I never really thought this was a big deal, but I noticed that whenever I eat with men this seems to really bother them a lot. And not in a ‚Äúconcerned about you‚Äù way, in like a ‚Äúoff putting‚Äù and ‚Äúyou did something wrong/abnormal‚Äù way. I am a very short girl, and have a small mouth, so it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not eating, but it‚Äôs hard for me to eat fast/finish the full dish without getting really full.

It feels very impolite to me because it will be food that I payed for, ate a regular amount (I‚Äôm not out here eating like 3 fries), and bring back in a doggy bag to not waste it. 

What‚Äôs funny is that then the next time I‚Äôll eat more and they‚Äôll be like ‚Äúyou ate a lot‚Äù and then ask for the rest of my food while I‚Äôm still eating LOL.

How can I deal with other people eating less than me?,"I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible person, but it's something I really struggle with when trying to recover. 

So recently, I've been beginning to notice my older sister eating less than I am. Like for example, we had made tacos earlier and I noticed that I had two and she only had one. It's made me feel absolutely awful about myself and all I want to do is relapse. (I know this sounds a bit dramatic, trust me) I've also noticed her eating less in general which is a bit unusual, and instead of me being worried, I've become increasingly agitated and triggered by it. I'm not annoyed with her as a person, but just at the fact that it seems she's eating less than me. I'm also pretty agitated with myself for feeling this way. I feel really awful about it. We are both very close, and I already know that she doesn't have an eating disorder, so it might just be some appetite issues. But still, I hate that I feel like this. I want to know how to deal with it, and to not let it get to me. But, I've always been insanely competitive and I always feel like I have to eat less than everyone around me. I really hate this about myself, and I don't want to feel that way anymore. I just want to recover in peace. Am I selfish for this? How can I deal with being so competitive?

Terrified about eating at Family's Place,"
I'm gonna spend the next 4/5 days with my family bc of a birthday and it terrifies me. 
They cook much, heavy, fatty, unhealthy, typical german food and you just know eating one meal will have more kcal than I normally allow myself. But it will not just be one, it will be three and Cake, everyday. 

Which makes me scared of gaining weight. I know much will be just bloating, water,... But that doesn't change the number on my scale. It scares me so much that it was for most of last week the only thing I could think about and only got 2 hours of sleep bc I could stop my brain

Does anyone have any tips how to deal with that fear?

On top of that did I just reach a good weight where I could be okay (even when my minds tells me otherwise)
But I will lose that and will hate myself for that.


Another thing is that I can't really eat as much anymore and then I will feel sick (like throwing up but I never do) and I hate that feeling.

dr said i must be eating enough calories based on my appearance,"after years of losing my life to this shit my i am at a point where my therapist and my mom are making me see a nutritionist and are possibly going to send me to inpatient. im very lucky to have a mental health care provider and a parent who care this much, and i feel bad that i‚Äôm stressing them out to this extent, but i am very upset about all of this. my old therapist didn‚Äôt bother focusing on what i guess is now officially my ED and at that time neither did my mom. i spent over a year and a half of my childhood in a group home and the idea of going back into any type of residential treatment makes me feel like i‚Äôm going into shock.

today while at the dermatologist, my dr was asked me whether or not my diet was good. i reluctantly said no. she then with good intentions asked if i go off a typical teenage diet with a lot of ‚Äúwhite foods‚Äù and ‚Äújunk foods‚Äù. i said no, the opposite, and then once met with silence elaborated that my other health care providers don‚Äôt believe that i eat enough. she responded by saying that i ‚Äúmust be getting enough calories in because you look healthy.‚Äù 

she was very nice, im not mad at her. im mad at the fact that it‚Äôs not fair that my body can‚Äôt lose weight anymore but i‚Äôm not skinny and ‚Äúlook healthy‚Äù. i have lost out on so many experiences, friendships, relationships, just to ‚Äúlook healthy‚Äù. i have worked so hard and pushed myself for so long just to ‚Äúlook healthy‚Äù. im probably not going to be able to start college and am going to have to go back into the torture that is residential just to ‚Äúlook healthy‚Äù.

i suffer alone with this, never telling my friends sm them never suspecting a thing, because i ‚Äúlook healthy‚Äù and nobody would believe me.

Dietician and therapist giving up on me,"I began seeing my therapist and dietician early this year when I was really struggling. Through the beginning of the process they were very supportive and encouraging even when I wasn‚Äôt cooperating with what they were wanting me to do. Like I felt a genuine care and compassion in our sessions if that makes sense? A few months into seeing them I was getting worse so they said I could go IP or they‚Äôd have to drop me as a client. So we looked at programs together and I applied and VERY hesitantly went. I only stayed a month because I hated it there so much. So I come back almost weight restored and very motivated to continue recovery because I didn‚Äôt want to go back IP or let them down. I stayed good for a while and over the past month I‚Äôve been relapsing. I‚Äôm honest with them and they know what‚Äôs going on. This past week in session I was saying I never feel like I‚Äôm ever going to get better and venting about how much of a struggle this is. I was vulnerable and honestly saying I don‚Äôt want to relapse I want to recover but I‚Äôm stuck and don‚Äôt know what to do. The response I got in return was I can‚Äôt help you. She‚Äôs encouraging me to apply to IP again and I don‚Äôt want to (and won‚Äôt) go and I told her that. The rest of the session all she did was talk about how I have to go there to get better. 

Basically I‚Äôm feeling really abandoned and hopeless right now because even though they may not realize it, I use them as a major support system. I feel like that don‚Äôt want to treat me and like I get on their nerves because I feel like anytime they get the chance they just try to send me off to IP. I‚Äôm really hurt to be told that they can‚Äôt help me because I want to keep trying and I feel shut down. It‚Äôs making my urges worse because I‚Äôm feeling so anxious that they don‚Äôt like treating me??? I don‚Äôt know what to do I feel so lost.

i think my medication is causing me to binge,"so last year i was put on olanzapine, an antipsychotic. i still dont know why they gave it to me because one time they would say it was because of my anxiety, then say it was because of me hearing voices (which i dont remember), then they would say it was to help my emotional stability and impulsive behaviour. but recently i had a meeting with my psychiatrist and he said it was given to me to help me gain weight. i was so angry when i heard this because i felt so betrayed by them. since taking this medication ive been binging a lot more often but i didnt know if it was because i lost control after gaining so much weight so quickly in hospital. i knew olanzapine increases appetite but i had no idea that was their intention when they gave it to me. i feel so betrayed and i want to stop taking it",15b8trs,12,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15b8trs/i_think_my_medication_is_causing_me_to_binge/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-27 18:03:49

Mom cried because I am so underweight,Hello Everyone. Last night my Mom took me Fishing for a while and she took a picture of me and cried because of how I am so underweight. She also keeps telling me to take medications and to eat more but how am I supposed to eat more if I have a fear of weight gain that is like a barrier to me eating more and medications I am scared to take because of the side effects of weight gain that a lot of them have. I know side effects doesn‚Äôt mean its going to happen but I was on medication before like a year ago (Sertraline) and that put me all the way close to overweight and then I stopped taking them because my Psychiatrist was not calling me when he was supposed to and every time I call the office it goes to the voicemail so then I just stopped them and I started rapidly losing weight. I want to try to see if I can get in to see a Dietitian to see if maybe they will help me and also a therapist because of my mental health because I am also depressed and stressed due to life stuff. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore because she keeps telling me a million times to take medication and to eat more but she doesn‚Äôt understand about my fear of weight gain.

Seeking the reassurance to go to Residential again :(,"lol I apologize I post on here a lot but nobody I know gets this. I truly feel taken over by this insidious disease and now I am scared. I just saw my former psychiatrist and he really knocked some sense into me point blank said I need to be in a res program within the next seven days or I could die any day now and he said id be lucky to see you in a year if this continues. 

Although, EVERY professional says go to treatment my brain will like go in and out of denial and acceptance. I am not dumb and manage to do very well in grad school, but my brain is like not working in any ways that matter. I have this inner demon (figuratively speaking) that is keeping me from seeing the reality/severity of how terrible and sick I look/act/etc. I still think sometimes I am ‚Äúfat‚Äù and I overestimate what I eat and lie about throwing up the little amount I do eat. All I can actually eat is sugar, carbs, benzos, and nicotine. I am dating a psycho. My life is in shambles and I feel insane and I am not making any progress trying to fix this myself. I try and try but to no avail I get worse and the delusion of thinking this is normal grows. I want to finish grad school, ignore this issue, and go on with my life. However, when I am out of my states of denial the reality sets in that I just cannot live at this BMI and expect to be functional or make sound choices. I become a person whom I don‚Äôt even know. I feel like I am almost borderline with the rapid mood swings, intrusive thoughts, bad choices, impulsivity, losing friends, and I recognize it is like a slow suicide.

 I just need to commit and not leave treatment again but it fucking sucks! I tried and left because I couldn‚Äôt vape or drink caffeine constantly lol. I know it is beyond dumb. I hate residential but im 26 and I don‚Äôt want to die but can someone give any positive experiences:( 

I really need to stop prolonging this because its just a dead end and I keep going in circles and this issue hasn‚Äôt gone away because this disease is stronger than me and even though i hate the idea of gaining a singular lb I just do not want to die ugh sorry for the rant but dm me if anyone can relate",15avcxs,7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15avcxs/seeking_the_reassurance_to_go_to_residential_again/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-27 07:45:53

DAE family not know they're anorexic?,"TW - self-harm mentioned

I feel so invalidated on this sub. I see so many of you have been hospitalized and at severe low weights and talk about how worried your families are.

I've been underweight all my teen years prior to my ED (undiagnosed), now I'm 23 having my ED for almost 3 years now and have never been hospitalized, let alone my family doesn't even know I have anorexia. I've been eating a normal amount now since I'm moved back in with my parents, and man it's tearing me apart inside. 

I can't even cut anymore either because my family doesn't know I was cutting myself when I moved out of state, my scars are mostly healed now so they haven't seen them and I just hate not being able to give myself new cuts. I just don't want them seeing them.

My BMI rn is considered ""moderately underweight"" but the lowest it's been was ""severely underweight"" but nobody really made comments about it and I guess it's because I've always already been underweight. I don't have a therapist, so the only one I talk to about my ED is with my boyfriend, aside of him nobody knows about it. I feel like I want people to know, but at the same time I feel extremely uncomfortable with the idea of my family knowing and I don't know why? It's like this digusted feeling I get imagining them knowing.

Being sick.,"This is just a baseless rant with no direction lol. 

Im waiting and trying to create a life with more substance, more achievements but I only feel capable in prolonging my sickness. I can identify some strengths foreign to my eating disorder, yet it feels I am stuck and cannot employ these to get anywhere ""meaningful"" in life. I am ""good"" at creating concern, good at being fatigued, good at sticking to the diabolical routines I have confined myself to, good at understanding for a very finite length of time how to interact with the world so long as I have this anorexic ""security blanket"", I feel like I'm on the precipice of something good happening, but I can't see or feel it
 I fear this monumental change might just be a continuation of what has happened countless times: being sick and facing the consequences of it.  And yet, even identifying that really this needs to be dealt with now, I have no idea how to remin consistent, even with the idea of recovery let alone implementing it into a actionable routine. I am scared that depaite all the warning signs my body has given me, deep down, I remain unconvinced that I do need to change despite logically knowing I do.

manager keeps bragging about weight loss,"so for the first half of the year, i was teetering on the edge of a relapse until i got diagnosed with celiac disease. having to check the ingredients on everything and being super cautious about what i ate just kinda pushed me over the edge into a full relapse. nobody has really noticed any of my restrictive behaviors bc i think they just assume me not eating is bc of the celiac's. it doesn't bother me at all, but as a result i think people are more comfortable talking to me about weight and food compared to whenever it was very obvious i had an ed. 

anyways, one of my managers at the store i work at has been taking wegovy for weight loss and i s2g all she ever talks about is how much weight she lost and how little she eats. she keeps mentioning the amount of weight she lost in 2 months or how she can't eat more than x calories per day without getting sick. like bringing it up unprompted several times a day.

we work in a clothing store and recently she came in on her day off to buy some things. the whole time she was there she kept talking about the amt of weight she lost and what sizes she wears now. i thought i was just being irrationally annoyed bc of how competitive this shit is, but she was literally talking about it so much that another customer noticed and made a joke abt it to us at the reg after she left.

like im happy that she's more happy or confident but holy shit now i feel like i can't eat at work (or outside of work for that matter). or that i somehow have to ""beat her"" by losing even more weight in the same time frame, which is virtually impossible. ik a lot of my work friends have noticed how much she talks abt her weight loss and are kinda annoyed, but the competition aspect of my ed is making this literal torture. ik she can't read my mind (or the room) and nobody is forcing me to do an 8 hr retail shift on an adderall and a packet of tuna. but i feel like this whole situation has made this relapse go from bad to worse bc i have a goal to work towads and an irl person to compare myself to. and to top it all off all i want is a spicy chickfila sandwich (extra pickle) from the food court and i cant have it either way, ed or no ed!! this shit sucks!!!

TLDR: manager keeps talking about wegovy weight loss and is triggering the shit out of me. and even if the issue disappeared tomorrow, i still couldn't eat what i wanted bc i got diagnosed with the lamest autoimmune disorder.

Going back n forth - questioning my decision to recover daily.,"Uuughhh I just can't with this anymore. 
Two and a half months ago I checked myself into rehab for drug addiction. I was eating normal amounts of food before going there. I have never actually taken care of my eating disorder for the 7 years during which I've been living with it, just had replaced one addiction with another - anorexia with extreme substance use. After I quit using drugs, I didn't even notice how strongly the ED came back rushing into my life - into my body & mind. 
All those harmful habits n behaviours came back so fast, I felt so powerless. And thought I needed that to get through opiate withdrawal, the anxiety, the hot/cold waves, the paranoia, the psychosis I had, the shakes, etc etc. I thought to myself 'the ED isn't hurting me as much as drug addiction has' and justified it to myself and so kept doing it. Of course the weight dropped really fast and I felt euphoric as hell, well, you know how it is.
I am now out of rehab and I met someone there that I will be seeing soon (someone special one could say hah). He knows everything about my ED and other psychological issues, has been a great help to me, accepts me as I am and has been trying to help me choose recovery. And so I did - choose recovery (not for him, for ME) - or so I thought...
Now, it's, well... It's complicated. I don't know what I want anymore. I do want to get better but being a normal weight terrifies the shit out of me, mainly because the fact that I don't accept myself at a healthy BMI has made me go back to using drugs, so so many times before. Gaining the weight would be the easy part. But then, self-love, self-acceptance - that is what I need to work on and I know it.
I just know how hard the whole thing would be - recovery. And sometimes I feel like I don't have it in me to even do that. I feel like I need this disorder but also I don't want it!!!! UGH. 
I just don't know how I would live without it. How I would survive. I guess lots of you do or have felt that exact same way.
I try to challenge myself each day - but then regret doing that, feel so guilty and just go back to old patterns. I question my decision of choosing recovery each day and wonder if this is something I truly want. Because I know that I would have to give it my all and I am definitely not doing that at the moment.

Well I just kinda needed to get this out, rant about it. Though if anyone reads this and has any tips, experiences, even thoughts on the topic, feel free to share them, that would make me happy & remind me I am not alone in this world of ours.

What does a day in your life look like?,"Just thought I'd ask because I've been feeling awful. I'm 24 and doing nothing with my life. I got some really good advice that I'm basically like a 3 year old adult, and with mental health challenges I gotta be kinder to myself, but it's still really discouraging. I don't see anyone else around me living a life like mine, and I mean, of course I wouldn't. I don't go out and when I do I bet people think I have a bumpin social life haha I try hide my laziness and avoidance by telling everyone I'm busy all the time. 
So I thought if I shared a day in my life and maybe if other people did too we might not feel so bad. 

I'm struggling with addiction, anxiety, OCD and mood disorders ontop of the eating disorder. My life has been reduced to sitting on my couch and literally doing one of these things:
-smoking (I'm not giving anyone ideas but it's a weed mix and it's terrible for you, got hooked a couple years ago and can't stop)
-playing dreamlight valley 
-watching modern family, new girl, Brooklyn 9-9, schitts creek and suite life on deck
-doom scrolling 
-planning for a better life I don't think I'll ever get. 
-and can't forget the back and foot rubs from my not-brother-brother haha 

When I'm at home I'm wishing Id be out with friends, and when I'm with friends all I wish is to be home. I don't look deathly ill from the outside yet, but you can tell. And I have all the health symptoms you'd expect, I'm having issues with my kidneys so I need to pee all the time, I abuse laxatives so somedays I can't leave my house, I'm tired all the time, my brain function is obviously affected because I'm slow, 90% of what's said in a conversation goes over my head because I'm too spacy to understand what they're saying, some days its like they're speaking another language that I've learned a few sentences of, I can pick up some words but they're speaking too fast so it's hopeless to try keep up. Not to mention my brain is just full of myself all. The. Time. And I hate it, I feel so self-absorbed and selfish. I can't handle a conversation with someone much less keep up meaningful relationships. And the very few people who have pushed hard to be in my life I eventually avoid so much they leave. Which I hate! But I always say I'm going to hang out, make plans, time comes around and I bail because I'm not feeling good or I'm anxious or I just want to sit, smoke and be lazy. 
I can't keep up relationships, much less a job or an education. I'm just sitting in my crappy, small, bird infested apartment, living off my parents, waiting for something to happen. 
I'm not sure how much more I can take of this, and I'm trying to turn it around, but it's taking time and it's hard. 
One day though.

Thoughts,"Vent: I've read some posts on here. But I don't feel the same about mine. I'm not trying to take my life as some have written. I'm just struggling.
Imagine gaining twice the weight you got down to, I hate it. So sometimes since I've relapsed I don't eat meals, then if I do have something I feel like I'm not anorexic because I stopped starving myself for that snack oe meal. I have the books I need I just don't read them. I have no desire to read them even though they have the info I need. I know what a full meal is supposed to look like. 
A few days ago I went out with my husband to celebrate our 10th anniversary, before that a bunch of teens came into a shop and acted like i wasn't worthy to go literally where I was turning to look at some things. I thought how i used to be them just 1 year ago, how i was thinner last year. That stayed with me, went to the restaurant, got a salad but even then thought doesn't this make sense people think I'm doing the right thing being in a larger body ordering a salad. I couldn't even eat half of it. My husband encouraged me and I got just 1 more bite in. (His help and care was huge  in that moment) I was going to finish the rest the car but it just didn't happen. I hope I didn't bore anyone with all this.

Amenorrhea and pregnancy scares,"I'm in a very tough situation. I am not yet an adult but am legally allowed to consent to sex in my state. I also have a mom diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder who, very frankly, doesn't actually care about me. I really really wanted to go on birth control, but that didn't really get anywhere when I asked my mom. I also have a boyfriend of almost one year, and we have a very good sex life, but I always remember to use the pull out method around my ovulating window. Obviously, though, you can never be safe from pregnancy when a man is ejaculating inside of you.

I also have anorexia and bulimia which is widely known to cause amenorrhea, especially at the rate that I've been doing things recently. Although I am a very anxious person and I always worry that my latest binge was enough for ovulation to occur at some random time that I wasn't expecting, and I ended up getting pregnant. Right now, I have gone a couple of days of a missed period, and I am freaking out that I may be pregnant.

I am deathly afraid of the outcome with my mom if I end up getting pregnant. She is ruthless and will take any measure to make me feel terrible about myself and make me suffer. Does anyone have advice? Can anyone else relate to pregnancy scares vs. amenorrhea?

another family vacation ruined,"i am from colorado and my family and i are in florida for vacation. they‚Äôve rented this big air bnb and we go out to eat every day for at least two meals. they‚Äôve been on my ass at home for not eating enough so i decided to eat all meals and snacks on vacation so they‚Äôd think i‚Äôm okay. i didn‚Äôt realize how miserable this would make me though. 

since the house we‚Äôve been staying in is absolutely huge i have my own room. now i know i can workout at night when everyone‚Äôs asleep and it‚Äôs not that i‚Äôm lazy (or maybe it is) but it‚Äôs that i‚Äôve been fainting a lot recently and i don‚Äôt want to risk hitting my head on the ground without anyone knowing. 

i have been isolating and avoiding my family on this vacation because i‚Äôm too busy thinking about food. i am also a recovering addict and the drugs i was doing are known for making people drop weight fast, so using has been heavy on my mind also.

i dont know how i feel about recovery,"so i was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa last year but ive been experiencing it since maybe 2018/2019. ive been hospitalised when i was at my worst; that was a year ago. since being in hospital i was forced to gain weight so i gained a lot. since discharge ive been feeling really emotional about the weight gain and i cant stop thinking about my body and food. i have times where i would binge and tbh i dont know why. i saw somewhere that lots of people who recover from AN start binge eating and it could be wrong but it scares me everyday. my current weight already upsets me, let alone gaining more weight because of eating uncontrollably. im definitely past the denial stage but i dont think im ready for recovery. im sorry if anything i said makes me sound like an asshole",158mmlt,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/158mmlt/i_dont_know_how_i_feel_about_recovery/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-24 20:49:28

Trans anorexic,"TL;DR at bottom, kinda of a long vent

I can‚Äôt gain weight , and I just want to be at my old weight :(

Hi y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm trans MTF, and I feel as though me and my trans friends have dealtt with some form of Ana or ED. I feel as though a lot of the trans community regularly deal with EDs (and self harm) but I wish this correlation was talked about more, it‚Äôs so common! It‚Äôs common for mtf and ftm folk, androgyny, femininity, and masculinity value thinness, value a sharp jaw, prominent collar bones etc. What I‚Äôve noticed though is that my ANA had gotten horrible, I was at my lowest weight most disordered etc. But as I got on hormones and started noticing changes in fat distribution and breast‚Äôs growing etc. I became so much more comfortable that slowly I started eating more and more. (I also started self harming less, coincidence? Lol I think not)

I wish trans folk could just get the gender affirming hormones, surgery‚Äôs, etc. I feel like I went to my lowest weight just so that when I gained weight it would be ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù and eventually I‚Äôd be thin enough to pass as a girl. What I‚Äôve found though is that the more weight I gain (starting at my low weight) I just get more and more changes, the hormones work better , etc. I really wish I could have just started the process earlier, My ED had developed before starting hormones and I didn‚Äôt realize how much it was effecting the changes, slowing them down. 

If I had been able to start hormones earlier I maybe would have avoided this further development of my ED. 

My eating has gotten a bit better since starting hormones, but now I‚Äôm stuck in the ED mindset. My ED is loud as ever and I‚Äôm still stuck with these disordered thoughts and behaviors. It‚Äôs really a struggle to finally want to gain weight and ‚Äúrecover‚Äùbut I feel stuck in this fucking anorexic night mare. Anyways thanks for reading. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt being mad about the lack of trans affirming medical care; I‚Äôm just so fed up ! I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can relate. Let me know if you‚Äôve also noticed this I feel alone  

TL;DR: Anorexia developed because gender dysphoria, ANA took me to my lowest weight, finally got to start hormones, I want to gain weight to look more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù (in my eyes) but I‚Äôm stuck in the ANA cycle. Maybe if I got the care I needed the ANA wouldn‚Äôt have developed or I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten so sick. I feel like a lot of trans folk deal with this.",158fwx5,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/158fwx5/trans_anorexic/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-24 16:45:04
Stress not-eating,"For the past year or so, and off and on before then, unless I‚Äôm in a really good mood or the food is out of this world, I‚Äôve hated eating. I hate the taste in my mouth. I have to push food to the side to chew so I don‚Äôt taste it. 
I often can‚Äôt tell the difference between feeling hungry and wanting to puke, so I wait until I have to eat in order to concentrate.

It‚Äôs much worse when I‚Äôm stressed, which is all the time because I have poor emotional regulation and dislike my career path.

I don‚Äôt have an unhealthy body image in the sense that I‚Äôm not doing this to be thin. I can recognize that I am unhealthy, and I am too thin. When friends see me nowadays they comment on it without fail. I used to think maybe it was because I used to wear my husband‚Äôs baggy clothes most days and recently I‚Äôve been wearing my own clothing again, but that wouldn‚Äôt explain why even my family tells me I‚Äôm looking thin. Technically I‚Äôve only lost a few pounds, but I didn‚Äôt have much to lose in the first place. 

The in-laws are in town for this month which is great because I adore them and they‚Äôve taken a big load off my shoulders by cooking a lot, but it also means my gig of pretending everything‚Äôs fine is up. In-laws want to know, ‚Äòwhy isn‚Äôt she eating? Does it taste bad? Is something wrong?‚Äô When it was just my husband I was able to explain it away better, but I can‚Äôt with three sets of eyes on me.

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to get better, but I‚Äôm dreading having to eat when I don‚Äôt want to.

"My friend suffers from anorexia, and she triggers me","I don't really know what to do. My friend suffers from anorexia nervosa. We're at very different stages. She's still deep into it, while I'm trying to recover.

This friend and I often talk about our issues. She's 20yr and goes through similar hardships that I went through myself and I like giving her advices on things, encouraging her etc, despite my own mental health problems. And I do so too, less frequently, but giving her advices helps me to have more retrospect on my own situations. It's a win win situation for both of us.


So often, she also vents to me about how she doesn't like her body, her weight goals, how she doesn't eat and how much weight she loses because of it. And as much as I appreciate that she feels comfortable enough to talk to me about it, I'm trying to recover from my own eating disorders, and listening to her talk about this triggers me a lot. It's been less than a year since I'm trying to recover so I'm still very sensitive to this type of discussion. I've recently relapsed into anorexia because of a discussion we had a month or two ago. I'm 18yr who lives alone without any support system, so it's complicated to snap out of this mental state by myself. 


I don't know how to deal with it. I know she isn't doing this on purpose, and I want to support her as much as I can. But she isn't ready to recover yet, which I understand because it's very hard, I've been there after all. But I also care about my own mental health and sometimes it's just mentally draining to hear her talk about how much weight she lost, watching the body checking videos, her saying how disgusted she is by food etc. 

Am I selfish for thinking that way? What should I do?",158ertr,38,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/158ertr/my_friend_suffers_from_anorexia_and_she_triggers/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-24 16:02:37

Angry at therapist,"I (F18) Initially requested help for my eating disorder and suspicion of ADHD. They wanted to screen me for ADHD, treat my ed and help me regulate my emotions since I haven't learnt doing so in my teenage years.

I have suffered from Anorexia-BP for 5 years and I recovered all by myself because they take way too damn long to offer any help, I was severely underweight and never got a proper diagnosis because I was never professionally assessed when I was underweight and I think most of you can relate that having one is a nice validating feeling.

They diagnosed me with ADHD and are now giving me therapy for emotion regulation and learning how to identify them. They wrote a report about me and they dare saying that 'in the past my symptoms would have been enough to diagnose me with Anorexia Nervosa, at this moment there is no question of an eating disorder.'

Reading this triggered my so bad and I just wanted to burst out crying in front of my therapist at how invalidated it made me feel and even though I'm at a healthy weight now that doesn't mean I'm still struggling and have relapse thoughts. I'm still sick and they invalidate me by saying I don't have an ed anymore and it makes me so angry and sad and it's like they're challenging me to prove them I'm still sick.

I don't think I'll ever be able to recover...,"I'm not shit-talking recover, not at all, I just... I need to get this off my chest. 

I'm, well, I'm overweight, I used to be obese, diagnosed with atypical anorexia.

And I won't lie, I often feel like I'll never be able to truly recover until I at least know how it's like to be thin, I have been overweight practically my whole life.

I also recently lost the only thing that could be some sort of motivation to recover; I was, well, still am, desperate for adhd meds, I was lying to my doctors for over half a year saying I'm in recovery. It got me nowhere, I'm afraid with ""F50.1"" in my papers it's truly a lost cause.

And so.... I gave up, lost my only drive in life, without meds I can never hope to fulfill my only dream in life 

I came clean to my doctors, they're genuinely horrified and kinda losing their minds trying to figure out what to do with me, one is threatening to section me, the other is telling me I'm going to die

Eh... idk man I honestly just don't have any reason to even try anymore, what's the point?

I'm a disabled loser, I live in the middle of nowhere, I Will never be able to fulfill my dream, I don't even have any friends here 

In my hollow and empty life, anorexia gives me a reason to live and keep going, because maybe things will get better when I'm thinner, maybe, they have to...

It's a coping mechanism... One I can't get rid of, for as long as my life is hollow and meaningless 

And the way things are now, it's unlikely my life will gain any meaning anytime soon.

i just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore‚Ä¶,"okay i‚Äôve got so much running through my head and i just need to dump it somewhere and hopefully maybe get some advice??

so i‚Äôve had AN for around 5 years now and in that time had many admissions to both public and private hospitals, as well as fluctuated in weight, had short periods of semi-recovery and had relapses.

at the moment though i just feel so f****ng lost.
i am currently in a public hospital and am on a meal plan and on 24hr bed rest. i haven‚Äôt been complying with the meal plan because 1. it‚Äôs far too much for me to eat it all and 2. im meant to be supervised while i eat but not every nurse is very vigilant so depending on how much they are or aren‚Äôt i will hide more/less food. but for the most part they‚Äôve been pretty not alert so i‚Äôve been hiding majority of the food. i try and eat at least enough though to stay stable.

 i find it so so impossible to find reasons to eat. i rarely feel hungry except for in the mornings and im only eating a bit at the moment here because i ‚Äòhave‚Äô to. because if i don‚Äôt i‚Äôll get tubed etc. 
ultimately i want to go home, but i know if my anxiety gets in the way i won‚Äôt be able to sustain things. i‚Äôve told my mum i want to try and just stabilise, maintain my weight, but the thing is that is going to still require me to eat. sometimes i feel like i might be able to cope with eating something manageable but enough at home and other times i feel like the anxiety just takes over and does not want me to eat at all.

i‚Äôve been to a private clinic before but the program is a voluntary one and also there‚Äôs not much room for preference in terms of management. i personally don‚Äôt feel with where i‚Äôm at at the moment that they can cater for me especially if i can hardly get through my meals. there‚Äôs also the fact that it‚Äôs not enforced on me and so i know my ed will use that to its advantage and i may end up just rejecting food there too.

im still currently sectioned so technically stuck in this hospital as i have been for two weeks, but it‚Äôs just getting to the point where i can see im not getting anything out of being here‚Ä¶ but i don‚Äôt know where to go from here.

i want to live a life and do things. but i am also scared. i can‚Äôt bring myself to eat when that voice takes over, it makes me so anxious i either freeze up or curl in a ball and howl for hours or want to bash my head on the wall or claw at my skin because i am so uncomfortable in my body. or sometimes it‚Äôll make me pace around (which i can‚Äôt here obviously cause im stuck to a bed) for ages and ages.

i just don‚Äôt have any incentive or want to eat. i want to live but i don‚Äôt. i want to move on with my life but i can‚Äôt. i just don‚Äôt feel capable of any changes yet i fucking hate how things are. i don‚Äôt want to gain weight even though everyone wants me to. im just so lost. where do i go from here. if i go home and can‚Äôt cope it means more fights and more admissions and if i stay here im obviously doing shit cause im just hiding all the food and it‚Äôs just a general hospital so no one is educated in eating disorders. if i go home and tryyyy my best to eat it might keep me out but then there‚Äôs the fear that it won‚Äôt and i‚Äôll be eating and will still have to go back to hospital or a clinic. 
i don‚Äôt want to fight with people i just want to be alone but i also know if i was alone i just wouldn‚Äôt eat, or at least not much or enough anyway. but eating more makes me so incredibly anxious i spiral. 

what is my life im just so fucking lost i‚Äôm sorry i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm really saying anymore other than i just don‚Äôt know what the answer is it seems like there is truly no way out, no answer‚Ä¶ üò£üòû",15771t4,6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15771t4/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-23 06:27:19

How do you see yourself?,"Hi everyone,

I am really curious about how those with severe restrictive eating see themselves. Anorexia is characterized by an extreme preoccupation with weight and body image. But I really wonder about people who are extremely visibly underweight, to the point where they are quite literally skin and bone. Do you still see yourself as overweight, compared to others? Or are there different thoughts that maintain the eating disorder? This question is asked with absolutely no judgement, ED‚Äôs are horrible and terrifying and absolutely all-consuming. They are so difficult to treat and to those of you who are dealing with this, I know you are quite literally fighting for your lives. I‚Äôm just trying to better understand what keeps maintaining the disorder even when you are at the point where you know, objectively, that you are much thinner than most other people.

"Trying to ""recover""","Spoiler: my story is completely bizarre and stupid. 

Im gonna sound really weird but Ive had anorexia for a week now. I know. Stupid. But what happened was I got really frustrated with my belly fat and no amount of exercise worked so I started a no sugar diet which has been confirmed that it works for belly fat. But then I search up thinspo on tumblr and things went downhill from there. Slowly I started following all the anorexia tags and I became addicted. I have a personality prone to addictions and its really easy for me to get completely absorped in something. My whole mindset changed within days. I never counted calories and I actually was insecure of my skinny body and now I dont think Im skinny *enough*. Its crazy. It got to a point where Im scared to eat a peach or a yoghurt because of calories. I realized that if I dont stop, Im gonna be in a lot of trouble. 

So what I did was I deleted tumblr and pinterest. I decided Im gonna just do my no sugar diet (i did it last year as well for health reasons)and that Im gonna eat 3 times a day like a normal person. Well, its easier said than done. The obsessive thoughts just wont stop. I keep seeing calories instead of nutrients. I keep thinking im gonna get fat if I eat a banana or one cookie. Im really worried for myself and i know I should do something with it but its only been a week.

"It's a disorganized mess, but I needed to vent...","I'm trying to recover from my anorexia relapse on my own since I don't have and can't afford any medical help (my job doesn't offer insurance cuz I work only 30 hours/week). I have a pretty decent support system with my boyfriend and his family. I'm very honest about my behaviors when it comes to food, and everyone looks out for warning signs then distracts me. I just struggle to eat breakfast and lunch, because I live alone (this is important to note because I've noticed I need verbal reminders to eat, not just alarms) and I need to work through the times I would normally eat lunch. At dinner, it really depends whether I eat or not. A lot of the times, I can't afford groceries and food banks I can go to are only open while I'm at work. I'm always allowed at my boyfriend's house for food, but I feel guilty because they're also financially struggling. BF also orders me food from Doordash when he can afford it, which makes me feel worse because I'm never able to finish a meal, and he spent extra money on the food to get it delivered (plus all the extra fees). 

I've told my boyfriend and his mom what I learned about eating disorders when I was in residential 6 years ago (I was 14, 20 now). They know my triggers, and for the most part how to support me. BF has even been doing his best to be careful with the words he uses to explain things or talk. 

I'm starting to feel like a burden to them. They do so much to help me, but I can't do anything to help them. Even if his mom catches me helping with the chores, she'll tell me ""stop. you know you don't need to do that. I'll do it later."" She's asked my bf to do some chores while I was there one day. I decided to do them instead, and she told me to let my bf do it. It just feels like I NEED to do something to repay them, because they've already helped a lot in my recovery process, despite it not being 100% yet. I'm positive they're the reason I'm feeling more energized. Without that family, I most likely would not have continued to eat after moving away from my own family. I didn't notice my eating habits after moving out until my jeans didn't fit me. Looking back, I only ate while I was with my friends or boyfriend - which was not very often due to work.

Writing this I'm thinking that maybe I shouldn't be living alone. I think I might need residential again, but because of money that's out of the question. BF and I are talking about moving in together soon, but that would mean he would be with me every single day, and have me eat every single day. Not only does that thought give me anxiety, but I feel guilty for it because I know how frustrating and difficult it can be to help an anorexic. It's a lot for my bf mostly because he's the one dealing with my outbursts. I get so frustrated when I need to eat more than I'm used to, and the frustration quickly turns to anger. I feel awful about my behaviors after the fact, and I've actively been trying to work on them, but sometimes I can't let go of those feelings. But if we move in together, he might have to put up with more behaviors and I'm terrified of that. I don't want to be a burden to him, but it feels like that's what I am. Not being able to repay anyone just makes me feel the need to vent.

Btw, we've been dating almost 18 months. I'm originally from the SF Bay Area, moved to the Chicago area just over a year ago to be closer to him. I was planning on moving to IL anyways, I visited Chicago in January 2022 (over my birthday) to experience the winter weather before moving to the state. I kinda regret leaving California for Illinois, but I don't at the same time because of my new family here.

My brother is threatening to send me to a mental hospital. Help?,"Hello. I'm 31 and I live with my older brother. Diagnosed with anorexia. Was in recovery for the past 2 years, but I relapsed a month ago.... 

I've been losing weight for the past 3-4 months though and I'm almost underweight again. I don't even know how I've been losing weight. I haven't been trying at all, except the last month. Most of the weight I've lost has been totally unintentional.

My brother and I got into a huge fight about my weightloss tonight and he's threatening to send me to a mental hospital if I continue losing weight. I told him it was an accident, but he thinks I'm lying. 

He wants me to gain the weight back, but to be honest, I don't want to. I'm terrified of weight gain. And I'm not even skinny. 

He said he's going to force me to step on the scale every 5 days. He treats me like a child.

"this week i havent really experienced alot of guilt from eating, BUT","It feels like anything that isnt my comfy restrictive meal makes my stomach feel so AAAAAA, like it feels like i have a fucking dumbell in me and my body genuinely needs days to digest a meal that isnt my plain simple clean meal, carbs especially (always had this issue but after restrictive eating it got worse) i am not even like underweight yet but it just feels so...my stomach is like... i hope this dosent break the numbers rule but after eating more carbs i have for a few days one extra unit and it feels uncomfortable


Like it also kinda hurts and my heart accelerates, and PS, i do NOT, binge, unless you count eating like an average person to be a binge which i gues for me it kinda is? I dont feel guilt necessarily tho that might be because i reaaaaaaallly avoid the scale for a few days after something like this happens, only to then return to my diet that is easier for my stomach to handle

medication question,"Hi sorry this is all over the place. Basically, I have been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, severe OCD, anxiety disorder, panic attacks and ptsd. 

Literally every fucking thing and I think my ED is probably just the tip of the ice-berg that people can see but i believe it is all attributed to the other mental issues/addictions I have had in the past. 

I really lack insight into how I look and everyone in my family tries to explain how terrible it is to see but I genuinely still think I am fat even at an absurdly low weight. I have moments where I realize I am sick looking but go in and out of acceptance and denial as I am sure many people have too. If I am honest I just want to be x weight with no mental issues or medical problems. However, this isn‚Äôt possible. I am 26 and feel like a 14 year old mentally. 

All of my mental issues are exaggerated by this disease that I honestly don‚Äôt even remember purposely choosing as the general population seems to think anorexia is a choice.

I only feel safe in hospital,"It sucks to admit, but hospital is the one place I feel safe. 

I dread going home on leave - it makes me feel so suffocated and depressed - and even more so, I dread being discharged. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I hate it here. There‚Äôs nothing to do, everyone is ill and competitive and I‚Äôm being forced to gain weight. But it‚Äôs also the one place that gives me permission to eat, where I can rest unconditionally, where I am free of obligation and the pressures of adult life, where I have an excuse for missing out, where (a few) people give me the time of day, where I can hold up a routine, where I can be social if I feel up to it etc etc. 

I hate being here but I think I hate home more and that feels rotten. The closer I get to discharge (harm reduction, nowhere near weight restoration), the more I will my body to plateau in the weight gain to postpone discharge and the more I want to relapse when I get out, and I dread that painful feeling of hunger again.

Binge dissociated?,"So i restrict heavy and it becomes a thin line between constantly fasting. When i break fasts it‚Äôs for the bare minimum of fiber or protein. I‚Äôve been pretty tired and crash during workouts past few days. Something came over me and I wanted to eat my protein bar I saved with some fruit. That‚Äôs like THE big meal for me. But then a couple bites in.. my mind actually stopped. I don‚Äôt have any thoughts and I become animalistic. This has happened couple other times in the past. I believe it‚Äôs a form of dissociation at this point. I start watching myself eat more from my kitchen and I‚Äôm mentally screaming to stop but the physical brain in my body is telling me to try and taste anything I want in the kitchen to find a satisfaction that won‚Äôt be met. Disappointed I mindlessly move to something else. I wish I could say I lack control in these moments but I‚Äôm not there mentally. There is no connection between my mind and body. It is really scary being ravenous . The Anorexia mind will preach self control but I become a mammal in these moments that control doesn‚Äôt matter. Nothing matters !!my body is just trying to get satisfied. If you watch nature documentaries like me , you may know what I‚Äôm getting at. I just feel like a mf lion watching prey. I sit hungry and tired at a distance. Eventually it is either to die in the wild or the instincts to use my teeth and hunt what is ever in front of me. This is why i restrict so hard. This is my biggest fear that if i just have portioned sizes ,the animal inside take over. It‚Äôs silly as it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy lol. I‚Äôve been having nightmares lately too ed unrelated. Genuinely food is a waking nightmare for me.

Heart problems when not underweight?,"vent/question: i dont really have anyone to talk to about these things sorry if its all over the place. 

Is it possible to experience heart problems from restricting if you aren't already underweight. I don't actually know my weight because i dont have a scale/choose not to know to avoid triggering myself. I think ive lost a significant amount of weight in the past 2-3 months? people have noticed the weight loss but i don't think im underweight. I have started experiencing heart palpitations/skipping a beat and it scares me a lot. Ive seen my doctor about it and they said its probably psychosomatic, because my heart rate and blood pressure are fine (although my blood pressure is very close to being too low), but im still scared about it, especially because ive been told other serious problems were psychosomatic in the past until further down the line when they got worse. I've suffered from disordered eating and reactive eating for as long as i can remember, but this problem started after a long period of restriction.

Set up my Bullet Journal ED Tracker," Anybody else here into bullet journaling? 

I'm totally fixated on it currently and this is my messy meal tracker page (hid anything that could be triggering).   
While I'm nowhere near ready to recover yet, I try to combine my need for control with mindfulness and creative outlet and make something somewhat positive out of it, also added coping mechanisms and self care stuff to the bottom of the pages.  


I'm a sucker for obnoxious word plays and was super proud to come up with the super discrete RnB (ya know, like that vicious binge and restrict cycle, but the other way round) Manager headline :D  
Almost finished, I slipped and put a huge line across the left page and almost flipped the table.   
Wondering what to do with it, I remembered I had a measure band washi tape I thought I wouldn't use because it's only triggering. So I put them on both sides of the page and doodled stuff over it to make a point of  rendering the numbers invisible :)  

Rant over, thought I'd share and maybe someone would like it lol   


Take care y'all <3

Fucking hell... I've been going through extreme food fear, probably bordering on a phobia, and funnily enough not only did all of that just go away as I binged, it didn't even help, now im done and it's back, actually even worse than before

I haven't eaten anything today that I didn't puke... honestly I'm unsure whether I should attempt to eat dinner or not, I'm fucking tired, but I know I'm extremely malnourished and really really need food, but now I'm afraid to even go to the kitchen ; - ;

I told my boyfriend I hate lunch time and now he's always inviting me to have lunch with him,"My boyfriend (23) knows I (22) have anorexia since the beginning of our relationship. In fact, he was the first one to even notice my behavior as an eating disorder and even asked me, without forcing it, if I struggle with that, when we were just friends. He's so attentive and caring.

I engaged in an awful semi recovery, but relapsed some months ago and even though I am really not that bad, it's... Getting worse. He knows it and it hurts him. 

Some days ago we're talking and we hit the topic ""anorexia"" and for some reason I started detailing everything I did in my worst phase, which he listened carefully till I end. At some point I said that I hate lunch time and I hate having lunch 'cause it's always the worst meal time for me. I remember saying it ""still is"" and it makes me anxious all the time. He said nothing, I kept going. 

Next day, he asked me if I could have lunch with him. Invited me to his home and I went, because I didn't really wanna eat, but I really wanted to see him. Anyway, he didn't push me to anything nor made any comment (about plate size/portion, weight, etc) and we ate together. After that, he started talking, making plans, asking me different things like: ""What'll you do today? How's your cats? When is that recital thing you told me you'll play? When will we watch Barbie?"", the most random topics... Which now I see is to distract me of guilty and anxious thoughts. Well, I might add it worked. Easily and painlessly, worked. Not for the full day, but most of it.

Next day, same thing. He did it for a whole week now, always asking if ""can we have a better dinner today?"", which I know he means ""bigger"" dinner, or asking me what I want for dinner and doing it without any other questions. He also asked me if the next day we could go out to eat (I understood it as him trying to make me prepare myself mentally) and we wouldn't go if I said no... I agreed, but didn't agreed for dessert. 

Honestly, it was a good week. He didn't force me nor push me nor even talked about ""anorexia stuff"", he just invited me to eat with him and even if I'd put too little on my plate, he'd not comment on it. I also noticed it became easier to eat whatever I wanted, even though I was portion-controlling. Indeed, I think I ate more than my ""normal"" this week, but I don't really feel guilty for that.

It's so sweety though. He's being attentive enough and taking care of me without saying a word, making comfy and helping so much, I hope he knows that. It's a cute way to help me and it's making me consider recoverying more than anything ever did. Surely I won't recover only because of him, but I know it'll be a lot easier with someone I love this much (and loves me back) rooting and helping me.

I hope everyone finds someone like him, truly do.",14zc00b,103,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14zc00b/i_told_my_boyfriend_i_hate_lunch_time_and_now_hes/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-14 09:47:07

No longer want to recover/have kids?,"
I am in my mid 20's and have been dealing with anorexia and overexercising since I was a teenager. In and out of treatment but haven't been weight restored in over a decade. No period in that time. I have been just barely hanging on in terms of weight and physical health, and I know (and boy do my doctors tell me) that it isn't a safe place to be. 

I used to want to recover. I dreamed of having my own children and a flourishing career. My husband was the one who motivated me most because I dreamt of us building a beautiful life together.

I am married. I own a home. I work my dream job. But I no longer want to recover. 

I gave up on the idea of having my own kids; I'm too scared anyway. I don't want to weight restore. I told my husband that the other night and it absolutely crushed him. I feel so selfish, but it is so hard to want to change when I am functioning and living (or at least, living to my fullest capacity with the ed).

Is restrictive eating still problematic if you're not underweight?,"Since early June, I've been restricting my calorie intake to a very low range per day. I feel better the lower number is, and I've had a few days in this span of time where I'll fast for a day. I'm only able to eat two foods without worrying about weight gain, anything else makes me nervous.

At this point, eating too much will make my stomach cramp up so bad that it can almost drive me to tears. I have a pretty high pain tolerance but the pain is insane. I guess my body has adapted to eating only these two specific foods and anything that breaks the pattern freaks out my stomach.

If I was underweight I would take this more seriously, but I'm not. I'm in the average BMI range. Actually, before June, I was overweight. I've lost a ton of weight since then. People are congratulating me for getting healthy and treating it like a victory that I've lost all the weight, and I feel conflicted about it.

Is it only a problem if people restrict like this when they're underweight? Is it normal that I want to continue restricting to this degree and see how much more weight I can lose? Or is this disordered thinking? As someone on the autistic spectrum, I have worries that this is just healthy behavior that I'm overthinking.",14y4xf9,49,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14y4xf9/is_restrictive_eating_still_problematic_if_youre/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-12 23:55:39

TW!! Asking for advice: it used to just be counting calories and now it's completely taken over my life.,"I'm not new to this diagnosis unfortunately, but I am finally ready to admit to myself that I have it. Unfortunately, since I've come to terms with this fact I've developed a couple new habits, other than just severe calorie restriction.

I have been struggling with my calorie intake since I was 12. Before that, I was a competitive dancer and didn't need to try, I moved so much I was always in a deficit. Well, I quit dancing due to financial issues, and I lost my muscle tone, and gained a lot of weight. Unfortunately this happened right as I was going through puberty. My body was used to me burning a set amount of calories, and adjusted accordingly as I went through puberty. I gained about a third of my body weight as I started high school. Horrible experience, but I never actually admitted to having the disease. Then covid happened, and I got better, temporarily. Flash forward, I'm 18, I refuse to eat more calories than I actively burn, add my base deficit on top of that and I lose about a half pound a day. I'm addicted to my fitbit, I refuse to take it off even in the shower, unless I'm charging it, in which case I sit on the floor next to it unmoving because I will not do anything without it on my wrist to tell me how much I've burned. I weigh myself about 6 times a day - after I drink water, after I eat, after I use the washroom, and log it all obsessively. I went completely vegan, in an attempt to stay away from meat, bread and cheese, without letting my mom know what's going on, I spent over 800$ (I hope this use of number is okay?) on something called ""body contouring"" which actually did work, but I stopped going when I realized that it worked because part of me felt tempted to eat more since I didn't have to work so hard. I wake up at 5:00am every day to go on an hour long jog, I'm at the gym for three hours every night after work - which I get off of at midnight. I only buy clothes that are sizes too small for me, telling myself I'll force them to fit me, rip the tags off right away so I can't bring them back, stare at them every time I get hungry, I've started to fit them now and it's just made it worse, I've gone from a few sizes down, to enough that the sales people ask if they're gifts. I've been diagnosed with anemia because all I eat are vegetables. I buy any and every cream or lotion that says it's good for skin tightening, trying to delude myself into thinking that it's just loose skin. I'm not ready to ask for help, but I never had these habits before I relapsed, and I'm not sure what to do. I can't keep living like this.

Recovery and relapse,"37f. Anyone recovering sometimes feel like your failing at recovery and at being anorexic?
I feel like I'm going no where with my recovery,  that I'm relapsing. And when I do eat the way I was taught to, I feel like I can't claim that I'm anorexic. But then I barely eat. And then I feel like I'm really wanting to eat and fighting with myself whether to eat. I've heard of people talking about safe foods. When I was at the eating disorder unit, they gave me things I wouldn't have usually, so being home I have pretty much what I feel like nothing new. Then I'm overthinking the cholesterol of things because of what I saw in April. My doctor told me it would take decades to get to a very bad place. Maybe I'm overthinking that because of the numbers from last year at the hospital when they told me on discharge that my numbers were ""exquisite"". I was also tiny. Now that I really overshoot my original weight I'm struggling alot. I see my doctor in 6 days. No psych., no good therapist, and no dietitian at the moment. Need support. Need advice.

I managed to convince my doctor to not send me to the hospital...,"I'm extremely malnourished and struggling to eat anything at all so yeah

He was like ""Well, Kass, in situations like these we can force someone to go to the hospital, this is seriously life threatening...""

And I answered ""cmon man don't scare me, don't do that to me""

And he was like ""well maybe not quite yet... But if you don't get better by next appointment it might be a possibility""

Made some vague promises of trying to eat more but I genuinely can't keep them.

So hey, have like 4 weeks of freedom left, god getting sectioned in a hospital for anorexia seems like the ""bad ending"" I'm fucking terrified, now knowing that they can actually do this... fuck

And I'm pretty sure that even if u do go voluntary, the moment I start refusing getting tube fed and such they'll swiftly section me and then they'll stop asking kindly.

Looking back at early signs,"Ps tbh i was hesitant to rwite this since i am basically letting myself vulnerable to 1000s of ppl which i didnt rly wanna do but here we go

I remember years ago when i used to avoid eating or drinking anything before going to a meetup be it with a friend or whatever because i was scared i will somehow friggin piss or shit myself (this NEVER happend) but i always had this fear in my mind at the back of my brain, i still have this fear tbh

I was disgusted by my body, and tbh to some extent i still am, I went from obese to lean in the span of less than a year basically.

I remember one thing i used to do was force myself to trow up randomly after a meal, or not eat for a whole day, and back then i was like ""i am just dieting"" but i look at it now and its like... oh. my. god.

Right now i am scared of most foods and whenever i eat its not even to follow cravings its just that i dont wanna die, i end up eating really low and once in a few days actually fill my BMR to keep me going.

Also one thing i noticed is that now sitting down can be painful if its not a soft area, or even touching my knees qhen i lay on bed, and i am not even underweight, just skinny.

Right now this tbh isnt really about being skinny, its about routine and control over my body, i feel very like... pure? When i eat clean and i feel light, but if i lets say eat a fried chicken i am basically like a melted icecream for a whole day (my body is sensitive and i get super sleepy) so ye",14xjqvn,13,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14xjqvn/looking_back_at_early_signs/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-12 09:43:53
What is going on?,"I'm obsessed with my weight and I just don't feel like I can articulate it out loud. Friends keep saying I'm wasting away etc. I've never been diagnosed with anything other than BPD, anxiety and depression. In high school I had severely restricted calories and went underweight. Eventually I gained weight and have been fairly healthy looking. I've never been overweight. Now I'm in my early 30s and I don't know what's happened but it's all come back. I am OBSESSED with weight, like my mood hinges on what the scales say. I have to get a minimum of x amount of steps in and I'm jogging loads. I feel like it is taking over my life but at the same time it brings me so much comfort. If I have paranoid or sad thoughts I just think about weight goals and food plan etc and I feel like everything will be okay. I'm still a healthy BMI etc so I feel like I don't have a right to question what's happening. I feel like frenemies with my own body. My friends are concerned and I'm terrified of gaining weight. 
Is this an eating disorder? My friends are saying they think I have one. I want to understand but I don't want to lose control of my food and body. I don't know if this makes sense I just needed to sort of reach out to strangers on the Internet who might help me understand.

I am hungry and I am terrified of the feeling of being full, so I have probably only finished one meal all the way all this year on accident. Like, I try to eat, I want to eat, I know its good for me, but I am terrified of finishing a meal no matter how big or small it is. Is this normal? And when I do get pretty close to finishing, I get nauscious and anxious. I hate eating around other people because I will either rock back and forth or ill tap my food until I am done and I just don't like talking. It has been 3.5 years since I really tried recovering.

Tired‚Ä¶. (TW),"I‚Äôm so tired of recovery right now. It feels like an endless cycle of trying a failing, over and over again. Every time I feel like I‚Äôm getting somewhere or making progress, something will trigger me and I‚Äôll relapse and end up right where I started or worse. It‚Äôs just been such a struggle sometimes to truly fix my relationship with food and exercise.

All my symptoms are back and worse then ever. I‚Äôm just scared of going back inpatient. I can‚Äôt do that again even though I know it might be good for me. I just feel like if I go back, I‚Äôm admitting defeat. I just can‚Äôt afford/let myself take time for myself. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I deserve it when I know I could be doing more. Ana is crushing me every day and I just want her to go THE FUCK AWAYüò°üò°. Even for just one day would be a relief. It‚Äôs so difficult when the fight is almost entirely mental. I can‚Äôt take medication to help me like other mental health disorders. I‚Äôm just tired of every day seeming harder than the last. I just want it to stop sometimes. The relief would be amazing. As much as I want it, I know I have to keep fighting. I understand that this will get better, but it can just feel so far away sometimes. Anyway‚Ä¶.. just wanted to vent some‚Ä¶

Feels like the ‚Äúharm reduction‚Äù approach is FAR more realistic than actual full Recovery‚Ä¶,"Since I was 10 my ED has shifted between restricting, restrict/binge/purge, and extreme Binge/purge.

It had been a VERY long time since I‚Äôve eaten the ‚Äúrecommended amount‚Äù for the day, but yesterday I was home alone and I just‚Ä¶kept eating. Like every couple hours I had a snack.

There I met this girl, we didn't talk that much but still follow each other on instagram. She was there for anorexia and was severely underweight. Now she's recovered, or at least weight restored.

I'm naturally really thin, always have been, my bmi is uw. I was uw even when we were in the hospital together, but at that time she was thinner than me. Yesterday I posted on ig a bikini pic, and she dm'd me privately asking if I was okay because I was really thin.

I don't know what to answer without triggering her. I also don't want her to think that I have an eating disorder. Help?",14vm0e1,60,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14vm0e1/my_friend_with_anorexia_asked_me_if_im_alright_bc/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-10 06:36:24

Preventing Binging,"I would like any advice on how to prevent/stop a binge. I just feel so compelled to eat and once I do its full steam ahead and I cannot stop no matter what I told myself before eating as well as the implications of the binge ie. gaining weight or feeling sick. However, once I inevitably do stop binging due to running out of food I feel horrible and know I not only damaged my body, but my mind as well. I now will compensate by eating extremely low calories for days until I fix the damage done and then do it all again‚Ä¶.. It is a never ending loop and I am conscious of it but nonetheless can‚Äôt seem to break the cycle. If anyone has tips or advice, any input would be greatly appreciated!",14vixa4,4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14vixa4/preventing_binging/,AnorexiaNervosa,new,2023-07-10 03:51:02
Anorexia turned into Binge & Restrict cycle,"Has anyone else with anorexia moved onto a binge and restricting cycle? I was dealing with anorexia for a couple of years, and it felt like I was doing better than before, but now I'm stuck in a bingeing and restricting cycle. If I do not count my calories, I overeat and don't understand when I'm full. I end up eating so much and then the regret and restrictions come the next day. Never have I had this much difficulty regulating my cravings. 

I honestly have no clue how to break the cycle. I've tried to eat normally, but it's either calorie counting or overeating. If I can't count calories, I end up eating more than what is healthy. I'm overeating and my stomach is bloated. I'm going to restrict tomorrow and see how it goes. I'm scared of getting fat, but my doctors and nurse don't seem to understand that I'm fat as it is. 

**Has anyone experienced something similar?** It's really worrying me, but I don't know why I cannot stop it. I'm not allowed to count calories for dinner time, and I think that is whats throwing everything off. Honestly, I'd rather be anorexic and skinny than deal with bingeing and being fat.

Panicking,"Hi:) this is my first post on here, I‚Äôm (19F), and have been diagnosed with AN for a few years.
(This is relevant) Ive also struggle with an intense fear of vomiting since I was really little. And recently I‚Äôve been experiencing a relapse in my eating disorder after a few months of trying to recover. Something that‚Äôs been happening though is when my Ed thoughts get worse I tend to physically lose my appetite, which in turn makes me incredibly anxious I‚Äôve lost my appetite due to illness, but if I have a large appetite I get just as anxious but more from my eating disorder. Even though this happens often whenever it does I still freak out. Does this happen to anyone else? Can an eating disorder physically reduce appetite?

I'm scared I'm going to relapse,"So, im 16 and has quite a tough year. I was struggling and eventually that lead me to restrict my eating. At first I hated it when my friend talked to me like to a disordered person (I read quite a lot about psychology, so I kinda know how to talk to struggling people), cause I didn't eat because I didn't feel like. But then it started: checking calories, eating less and less. At some point it was really bad. On a good day I would eat maybe 800kcal (but during the day I used to burn quite some chunk of that, pe, walking, things like that), on a bad day I would not eat at all. I got to the point that when during Christmas I started to eat more (love my aunt's food) I got thoughts like ""you're gonna get fat"", ""you're eating too much"". And that was the moment I knew I had to stop it

So I tried to eat more, in the meanwhile I cut off my toxic friend (the one that was treating me like a walking disorder, he was toxic for other reasons), my depression (alleged) eased and I got my normal weight. Now I can eat and everything, but I notice that more and more I start to look at the calories again. I don't want to do it, I try everything to just distract my mind and eat

But at the same time I kind of miss it. I miss feeling totally horrible. I miss almost passing out during pe (I know how it sounds). I miss not having to eat. I miss being able to sleep (for past week I've been having terrible problems with falling and staying asleep). I don't want to worry my new friends (not that new, but they didn't know me at the time when I was struggling), but at the same time I don't really want to fight it 

I don't know what to do. Started to post recently so I can ease my mind. If you think you may help me please just comment
I'm really lost

I don‚Äôt think I can or should recover,"I just turned 22 last week. I became anorexic when I was 9 and have had a lot of ups and downs. Most of the time I‚Äôve been heavily restricting, but I made a move toward recovery a few months ago and started working with a nutritionist. Long story short, I gained weight rapidly and haven‚Äôt been able to look in the mirror since. My current weight is considered overweight. I‚Äôve gotten dozens of blood tests, seen tons of doctors, and no one has an explanation for why I gained so much weight and why I am continuing to gain weight despite barely eating.

This is gonna sound so stupid. I recognize that everything i‚Äôm saying is ridiculous and small and doesn‚Äôt matter, but as i‚Äôm currently lying here on my yoga mat sobbing about my body I think I need to put these thoughts somewhere.

My ED is deeply tied to a need for male validation. I‚Äôve never been pretty and all my friends have always been like supermodel level. Every boyfriend I‚Äôve had has said my friends are prettier than me, my body is weird, and have overall confirmed to me all of the fears i have about my body.

So, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm 22 and i‚Äôve never had someone genuinely want me. I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôm trying my hardest to recover, but my worst fears are coming true. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm meant to recover. I think I‚Äôm supposed to always be like this so at least I‚Äôm not pretty but i‚Äôm working towards being thin. I wake up every morning and wish I could just vanish. I don‚Äôt want to go to work I don‚Äôt want to see friends I don‚Äôt want to do anything.

I‚Äôm sorry for being so dramatic. i‚Äôm genuinely so embarrassed to be sharing this at all. I just don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. I feel so lonely and unwanted and disgusting and hopeless.

Breakdown over binge,"Went to see an old coworkers band play at a bar that had a food truck. Wasn‚Äôt planning on eating as I had already hit my daily intake limit and knew I wouldn‚Äôt have time to go to the gym. I drank a seltzer then gave in and bought tacos. I intended on only eating the meat but I ate the tortillas too. After doing the math, I determined I was at 2x my limit. While I felt disgusting and a failure, what hurt more was how alone I felt. I was surrounded by people hanging out with friends, enjoying their food and having a great time. I was sitting alone because the only person I knew was playing. There‚Äôs no one I can talk to about this. My best friend is a recovered anorexic and I can‚Äôt bear to tell her about this. She lives in another state so she has no idea.

I think I've relapsed. Advice?,"Hello. I was in recovery for 2 years, but recently, I unintentionally lost weight, and now I'm finding myself scared of calories and weight gain again. I'm under eating again. This has been going on for a month. 

And yesterday, my brother cooked salmon in olive oil for me. I ate most of it, but I threw away the skin when he wasn't looking. I love the skin, but I was terrified of the oil that was on it.

It's so tempting for me to try and get underweight again. I'm so close.

I don't want to restrict again, but I have no idea how to stop being scared of calories and weight gain. And my depression isn't helping at all. When I'm depressed, I lose my appetite and I lose any motivation to cook. 

I'm depressed, because I'm currently living with my older brother and he's controlling and has gotten physically abusive a few times. He also sexually assaulted me 8 years ago and I don't think I'm over it. 

I plan on moving out, but it's not really possible right now. I'm hoping it will be really soon. I think I'll be happier once I get away from him.

Any advice is greatly appreciated :)

was the psychologist wrong to do this," 

I guess I'm just looking for validation here but I need to get this out¬†  
I had an appointment with someone to assess what to do with me, refer me to a therapist kind of thing ..  
We talked a lot about general screening stuff like you know, the family and everything¬†  
But the reason I got referred is the ED  
I  understand she was trying to assess the ""severity"" but when she  blatantly asked me how many calories I would aim for when I was really  restricting, I immediately burst out crying and couldn't answer because  I'm ashamed it's not bad enough and there's also the fact that I didn't  even freaking calorie count at my worst restricting phase, which I  didn't bother explaining. She also asked how much weight I lost in total  which fuckinh triggered me, but I answered anyway. (I'm not even 100%  sure what my start weight was)  
I consented to being  Weighed which was a terrible idea because again, I do not feel sick  enough. I feel a horrible disordered pressure to get worse before the  next appointment in a month or so now. I'm trying so hard to maintain  yet failing some days and just fighting with myself.

Have some sympathy or get out.,"This is a post dedicated to all those that think vent posts are pro-ana, bragging, unnecessary, stupid, or otherwise unsavory, and feel the need to belittle, ostracize, insult, ""harsh truth"", and be dicks about it. 

First off, you're wrong. Venting is encouraged and welcomed here, and does not break the subreddit's rules (unless it does). This is a fucking horrible disease where everyone experiences some of the same things, but also a lot of different things than someone else does. Those experiences aren't pleasant, they're probably not SFW, they're triggering. Amd that's okay, because people are allowed to vent about their problems, even if they don't want help. 

If you don't like someone's vent, don't comment. If you want to comment because you don't like someone's vent, but are going to give them ""harsh truth advice"", mock them, belittle them, insult them, invalidate them, or anything else that is otherwise unsupportive, don't fucking comment. 

This ENTIRE subreddit is under a trigger warning. It always has been, it always will be. Anorexia is a triggering subject. If you can't handle seeing triggering vents from people in the thick of it, ignore it and move on. If you can't handle seeing vents and can't control your urges to comment hate-filled, nonproductive, unsupportive things, this isn't the place for you and I'll escort you to the permanently closed door myself. 

I'm sick of it, and I'm not the only one. This is a support community. The amount of arguments, insults, unsupportive and outright *mean* comments I've had to remove just last night is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a community and I refuse to let this place go to the freaking dogs because a couple of you can't keep your unsympathetic mouths shut. 

While I can't control what people upvote or downvote, I DO control what gets removed and who gets permanently banned. Upvoting someone who's being an asshole makes YOU also an asshole, and downvoting those that come here for support and relatablity makes you a dick. 

Guys, this isn't highschool. The mean girls don't rule the school. The assholes are in the minority here, and the supportive community is in the majority. Don't stop posting here because of the people that decide they want to be dicks. The moderators have your back. If you see someone being a dick, report it. If you respond, make sure you're not breaking the rules or insulting them back, or your comment will be removed along with theirs. We can band together and *change*. We can drive out the people that aren't here to be supportive. We've done it before in the past, we can do it now. 

If you don't have anything nice to say, shut the fuck up and don't say anything at all. If people start arguing in the comments, I'll lock the post and they can redirect their arguments into modmail where I'll be happy to converse with them. 

Sincerely, a mod who's just about had it with those in the community that can't stop being dicks to others.",13qttgg,266,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/13qttgg/have_some_sympathy_or_get_out/,AnorexiaNervosa,hot,2023-05-24 18:39:47

if i get called ‚Äúfatphobic‚Äù one more time,"there is a person who i went to school with who, to put it bluntly, has become quite obese and constantly shares posts about fat acceptance and how you aren‚Äôt unhealthy if you‚Äôre fat, etc etc, fine. you do you, i‚Äôm not judging at all infact i literally wish i could be that accepting of myself but it was REALLY fucking with me constantly seeing how ‚Äútoxic‚Äù skinny people are and how wanting to be skinny is ‚Äútoxic‚Äù so i unfollowed her. 
she somehow notices this... private messages me asking why and i said that her posts make me feel bad for wanting to lose weight, initially trying to avoid mentioning how it‚Äôs an eating disorder not just a diet, and she absolutely blasted me. she called me disgusting and fatphobic and literally tried to call me out on her story. she said that by trying to fit an ‚Äúideal‚Äù body type i‚Äôm trying to silence fat people, and trying to demonise fat body types. i finally snapped and said that i have an eating disorder, i know how toxic my eating disorder is, but it‚Äôs a disorder and im not doing it because i ‚Äúhate fat people‚Äù and she just wouldn‚Äôt listen and basically insisted that trying to gain fat acceptance is harder than battling an eating disorder. i seriously,, sorry to say this,,, but can‚Äôt fucking deal with these ‚Äúwoke‚Äù bitches sometimes. fuck me. you can do whatever the fuck you want with your body, but calling me fatphobic for having an eating disorder is so fucked up. god",h17p1u,563,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/h17p1u/if_i_get_called_fatphobic_one_more_time/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-06-11 20:48:28

What the fuck is up with the guilt tripping of mods?,"If I remove a post, it's because you broke a rule. Saying that we're ""your last outlet"" and guilt tripping me into unbanning, unmuting, etc., you will do absolutely nothing but irritate me. Insulting me will result in nothing good, either. 

The last 10 people I had to have a conversation with? 90% guilt tripped me. We're not five year old children, here. We're all suffering from AN in some form or another, I get that, but the guilt tripping *has* to stop. 

From now on, guilt tripping after being told not to do so is just going to extend whatever sentence you've been given for breaking rules that are clearly stated. I'm tired of it, and I'm sure others are too. 

Thank you for those that spend time writing thoughtful, helpful messages and tell others when they're breaking rules, and especially to those that report for rule 10 - the rule that people apparently hate. (It's not being removed >.>) I may not participate in general chat much but I do appreciate those that help others on here & make my job easier.  ‚ù§üå∏ 

And for those that have absolutely nothing to do with this angry post about guilt trippers, I'm sorry that it's probably coming off agitated. Ignore it and continue on, you're doing great if you're not being a dick and not breaking rules(which, really, everyone should act like you guys).",f13q2c,475,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/f13q2c/what_the_fuck_is_up_with_the_guilt_tripping_of/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-02-09 04:40:06

My best friend‚Äôs heart stopped.,"I guess friends you meet in treatment have the possibility of dying but you don‚Äôt really care when you click so well with them, you know? She was the first person to talk to me during my first meal at inpatient- the first one to make me laugh after I had the worst day, having been admitted on Halloween. She was the one to encourage my recovery, even when she wasn‚Äôt getting better herself. She relapsed over and over again, in and out of ICUs and treatment centers but it never stuck. I stayed mostly weight restored for a while before starting to relapse. 

Two days ago, her heart stopped and she went into cardiac arrest. Thank goodness her mom was there to do CPR, she saved her life. But she‚Äôs still in the ICU and her heart could fail at any moment. AND YET she says she‚Äôs not sick enough and she thinks people will think she‚Äôs fat and fake. But she promised me she‚Äôd go back to treatment, on her own volition this time.

Triggered by a thin woman in the store today.,"She walked past me carrying a basket of candles and some coconut drink thing. My basket had a frozen pizza, salad and some regular coca cola. Immediately after seeing her tiny legs walk past I put my pizza back in the freezer. 

I went back and forth putting the pizza back, then picking it up again. I did this three times.

My head was spinning with thoughts of starving myself to look like her. 

I finally forced myself to buy the pizza. I need to challenge myself in recovery and I'll never get better if I constantly compare myself to strangers. 

The pizza is cooking in the oven now and smells delicious. I am going to eat the whole thing, even though my head is screaming at me to put it in the trash. 

I don't know why I'm sharing this but I just had to tell someone.

I tripped acid and saw myself for the first time,"As I was peaking, I stared into the mirror for what felt like hours, my eyes tracing over every sharp curve of my body, every jut of my rib cage and my thin veins all too prominent against my pale skin. I saw how sickly I was, how little, how underweight. I cried. 
How could I hate my body so much to ruin it? How could I let myself starve for so long? Why did I hate myself so much? 

I must've asked myself a million questions and all of them lead to the same answer; I loved to be in pain. Years of childhood trauma had led to my ED, years of restricting, purging and just treating my body like shit had led to this outcome. And I'm finally over hating myself. 

After my trip I've been eating consistently. Now I eat to feed myself. It's still difficult to eat but I like to think of it as I need to fuel my body and I take myself out of the equation. Your body is a simple vessel for your soul and both need to be nourished.

Y'all this is importantüò≠,"So I was diagnosed early this year with anorexia, while my mom has anorexic tendencies only (meaning not a full blown eating disorder). The thing is, she doesn't know about my eating disorder (just my dad) but we've kinda been on the same boat.

Recently, we bought a crazy amount of seasonal fruits and we made a fruit salad. I, at the very beginning of my ED, was very afraid of fruits but I forced a habit onto myself, which was to eat fruits as much as I want, cause I refused to put them under my ""fear food"" list. I just love them too much to do that.

My mom, however, only sticks to oranges and apples because she's absolutely afraid of bananas and pretty much all fruits BUT when she saw me grab two plates of fruit salad, she kinda got encouraged into grabbing one herself and SHE CUT A BANANA INTO IT. I'm gonna cry tears of joy.

Anorexia happens faster than you can lose the weight.,"The habits and obsession develop fast. First it's just losing weight by simply reducing potion sizes and moderate exercises with a few pictures for motivation and a reasonable weight loss goal. 

Then it's you're not meeting your goals quick enough. So you reduce even more portions, exercise a little bit longer, dig into research to find some good diet plans, and while your at it, look at more motivating pictures.

Then, great you're losing weight, but...not fast enough, so you decide ""maybe I should start counting my calories"". myfitnesspal becomes your best friend, you drink water and green tea like it's going out of style. You weigh yourself every morning, you begin pinching your fat while rotating at different angles while sucking in. You research more diet plans and now you are constantly looking at pictures, blogs, vlogs, social medias. You workout a little longer and a little harder. 

4 weeks goes by, CONGRATULATIONS!!! You reached your goal weight, now here's the real challenge, time for you to keep it. But you are so excited, clothes look great on you again, people are complimenting you. You start your old eating and drinking habits again, working out less, and eating more. 

Then in no time at all, you gained back more than half the weight. 

FUCK. 

Time to get back on track. But you are confident, you lost it before, you'll lose it again. 

2 weeks go by, but minimal change in weight if any at all , you panic. 
""What's going on?"" 
""Why aren't I losing weight?"" 
""This worked faster last time!"" 
""Did I plateau?""
""Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!"" 

Fuck it! 

You begin restricting, you turn to Thinspo which you KNOW is a psychologicaly ill community . But you don't care, you must reach your old goal weight. 

No scrap that, you must meet your new goal weight, you must meet the new goal weight because it further from your starting weight, and you can NEVER go back to that weight. You rather die. 

You don't realize it, but, this is the point of no return. 

Now your weight is all you can think about, if something doesn't involve losing weight you couldn't give a rats ass. School and work begins to suffer. Hobbies forgotten. Relationships strained. You don't want to go out with friends because you are embarrassed of your failure to maintain your first weight. They tell you they don't notice. They are fucking lying. They pity you because they know you can't keep the weight off, ""you love food too much"" they jeer, you'll show them. 

You restrict even hard, below the average total calories recommended. What does this article know about calories needed anyway?? Naked and Afraid contestants survived week's off of a fuckin spider! Surely you can survive off of 800cal or less, you got this!

 It's been weeks, this is your life now. Now you're always hungry and irritable, but you're not giving in. Meals are missed and supplemented with Water, green tea, black coffee, gum, and deit coke. You would workout 7 days straight but you are exhausted. So you start taking caffeine pills and ephedrine to workout, then you just take them to suppress hunger. Then you start taking them in hopes you'll lose weight while being idle. You weigh yourself several times a days. You have a panic attack when you wake up because you know what you have to do, then if you weigh yourself and see that there is no change, panic attack. You internally screem, 

""What more do I have to do, haven't I done enough?!"" 

Days turn to weeks, weeks to months, it's never ending. You slip up and binge, then you panic and purge, then you punish and restrict, it's a losing cycle. 

You are cold and tired, but more importantly,you are still fuckin FAT! 

But it doesn't matter, all this will go away, all the hunger, the tiredness, the self hatred, the pain. Everything will be fine, just as soon as you make your UGW.",hna7ou,296,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/hna7ou/anorexia_happens_faster_than_you_can_lose_the/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-07-08 04:10:01

"I'm anorexic, not fatphobic","It hurts when people call you a fatphobic when you're trying to talk about your anorexia. I know that I can't speak for all anorexics since some of them might be fatphobic. But in with that same logic, people can't just call me a fatphobic because I'm anorexic.

Yes, I want to be skinny, yes I don't like the fact I look fat, but I can't care less how fat you are. I think that _I_ look ugly because of _my_ fat. I think that _I'll_ only look pretty if _I'm_ skinny. I think that _I'll_ be more liked if _I_ lost weight. 

Honestly, I never looked at someone ""fat"" and thought ""wow, they are so ugly"". I don't judge others with the same scale I judge myself. In fact, every time I look at all of those gorgeous people who are scientifically overweight, I feel jealous that they can be beautiful without needing to lose weight. It's just not fair.

"If I don't eat, my abuser wins.","I came to a revelation yesterday that has helped me wrap my head around how to recover.

Part of the reason I struggle with an ED is because of past abuse by someone I used to trust. This person as in a position of power and decided to take advantage of my vulnerability in the worst way possible. To this day my abuser is trying to ruin my life. I starve myself to gain a sense of control.

Starving myself IS ruining my life. If I give into my ED, I'm giving my abuser another way to make me miserable.   


In retaliation, I ate two hashbrowns this morning. Maybe I'll even make something for lunch.

I did a good thing and idk who to tell,"My friends all know about my ED but I struggle to tell them when I'm doing well so I keep it quite quiet, so I thought I'd tell you guys instead, if you wouldn't mind. 

Yesterday, my boyfriend said something that would've normally triggered me into oblivion. But I was okay. I told him that it was too far, something I've never had the strength to do before, and was okay. It didn't make me feel as anxious as before and didn't trigger me nearly as much.

Also, this morning, my mum stood next to me and compared our sizes, saying she'll be as skinny as me soon. She's doing some dumb crash diet that I don't agree with cuz it's really disordered. But anyways, I was making my breakfast whilst she said this. And I carried on, and ate my breakfast anyway. On top of that, my breakfast was quite a big fear food of mine. So I'd say I did pretty well.

And my mum has lost a pretty big amount of weight the last week, and shes very proud of that and keeps reminding us how much she has. This would usually have a massive effect but it hasn't been stopping me from recovering.

I've eaten pretty normally for the last two weeks, have exercised to make me stronger not skinnier, and haven't weighed myself.

If anyone has got this far, thank you for reading. It means a lot, and I wanted to show someone that I'm going well. Secondly, if you're struggling, please just do one thing to try and recover today: eat a fear food, skip a workout, etc. Do it for me! Do it for yourself! I promise you can do this!

It‚Äôs so hard not to have a place where I won‚Äôt be judged for the sick part of me that wants to keep going with this life as dysfunctional as it may be. But I need community too.

I was planning on just grabbing dinner with a friend tonight and calling that my one meal of the day, but by lunch time I was hungry, so I ate. 

Then, after my last class of the day my sister stopped by and picked me up to go get ice cream, her treat. I wanted to say no, but thought ‚Äúhey I like icecream, let‚Äôs do this thing‚Äù so I got a big 2 scoops (same as her) and polished of the bowl. 

Finally, at around 7 I met my friend for dinner and she said she wanted comfort food so we went and got burritos! I ended up only being able to finish half of mine. But I stopped once I felt full and I was able to shut down the ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve already eaten so much, might as well binge‚Äù mentality. 

I ate almost like a normal person today and normally I would feel guilty/embarrassed. But I actually feel really proud of myself. Because for once I just enjoyed myself around food and didn‚Äôt let this disorder ruin my time with my friends. 

I just can‚Äôt believe that I don‚Äôt feel guilty.

I think I‚Äôm finally going in the right direction. I don‚Äôt know how I got here because last week I was at one of my lowest points mentally.

"Is anyone else bothered by the fact that they are women, thus curvier than men?","By this, I mean that our thighs are wider and ""juicier""... I don't even know how to describe how I feel.

I have always been naturally skinny and underweight but in the last few years, as I've gotten older, I started to look more like a woman. And I just hate it. Every time I'm watching a movie I compare myself to the women in the movie and I realize that they have the same body type. We are women after all and having a higher percentage of fat should be normal. But not in my mind. I just wonder, how the women in the movies are not self-conscious of their curviness? How do they accept themselves and even feel confident in their body? I envy them:(

And I also envy men... usually their thighs are not the first place to gain weight around. And during biology class, we talked about the difference between men and women: how men are the apple type and women are the pear type and I realize that, yet cannot accept and not feel anxious about it.

It's just so hard to accept these changes in my body. And I feel so alone with this feeling, none of my friends thinks like this. 

So if anyone here relates to this, could you give me advice on how to accept myself as a woman and not a skinny teenager anymore?

Hi everyone so I‚Äôve struggled for restrictive eating disordered behavior patterns since I was maybe 15 or 16 (by the time I hit puberty and started to notice my metabolism to slow a little and be being more prone of weight gain - idk why, maybe due to the media, but I‚Äôve always been very fat-phobic & extremely fearful of becoming obese or even being marginally overweight as I feel I would be ugly and undesired) and ever since, especially since moving into my own apartment my ED & restrictive, anorexic eating patterns and behaviors have worsened in intensity, in terms of the number of rules (very little carbs, fat, sodium and sugar) along w/ occasional guilt binges (eating a Burger King order probably meant for a couple and not finishing it fully & throwing the rest out of disgust and shame for relapsing). I‚Äôve been eating salads paired w/ fruit per w/meal each day to reach my goal. Long story short, the coordinator at internship site of mine for a class km doing looks to be very thin and I get severely triggered and upset because I feel fat in comparison whenever I see her (I analyze how her arms and legs for instance are a lot thinner than mine .

My little sister has anorexia and my family won't stop calling her fat,"I apologise if this is the wrong sub but I'm not sure where else I could ask for advice.

She barely eats anymore and tonight I cooked dinner and got her to sit down and eat with us. She even ate a couple of shrimp while talking to me in the kitchen. I felt so fucking happy that she was feeling good, and that she was eating.

My two brothers and my little sister went to eat in the living room while I stayed in the kitchen to set some food aside for my dad, my brother apperantly threatened one of our pups because ""she tried to take food from the cat"". This is bullshit, because that dog never does things like that and my little sister later confirmed what I thought. When my little sister angrily told him to stop talking to the dogs like that he snapped and told her to, ""Go back to pigging out"".

I went to my siblings to see if this was a good meal, and if it's worth making again, to see my little sister not in there and her plate on the table, with some of the food flung off as if she threw it down and ran.

I went to our room with her food to ask what happened and she told me. I tried to give her the plate but she refused and told me she didn't want to eat anymore. I said that I knew she didn't eat anything today, and that the meal wasn't super unhealthy. She still refused. I started to tear up and I told her how much I worry about her. I told her that if she just ate the food I would go outside and jump on the trampoline a little bit, knowing she loves it when I'm outside with her and that she wouldn't be able to burn off all the calories from 30 minutes of activity. 

She took a bite of shrimp and angrily said she was fine. I don't know what to do. My dad wouldn't listen, because he doesn't care. I'm lost and I'm worried about how to help her myself. I can't lose her. She feels like my own kid, in a way. I love her with everything in my being and she's honestly the only reason I'm here.

If anyone has any advice that would be great.

EDIT: Thank you all for the great advice. I've decided to make healthier meals so she won't feel as much guilt eating. I've started doing relaxed exercise with her, and I'm trying to help her lose weight in a healthy way while also trying to show her she doesn't have to stop eating entirely.

Opinions on timeline photos?,"i don't want this to come across as rude in any way, but seeing all of these timeline photos is SO DAMN TRIGGERING.

i am beyond happy that you're not as sick and malnourished as you used to be, i'm so glad that you're doing better and you've recovered.

but is it really necessary to show us a picture of what you looked like at your lowest, sickest weight? no, it's really fucking not.

what is it for, to validate yourself? to show others that you got to a super low weight? congrats, you're one of many!! i know anorexia is competitive, but if you're ""recovered"" and still needing to prove that you were ever sick enough then you're not truly recovered. we don't need to compare ourselves, we're all fucking ill over here.

i'm sorry, but i don't want to see it and it's just so negative for me. i don't mean to be rude but i keep seeing them pop up everywhere and it is the most triggering thing ever.

I enjoy the pain of hunger,"When my stomach rumbles or gives me the pain indicator that I need to eat food, it makes me feel so good.

After I give in and eat some food, during the meal I will like the taste and enjoy it. But immediately following I will feel extreme guilt and want to vomit it back up. Which makes me understand people who purge but I never want to start that habit.

Then the longer I hold out on eating, the more intense the hunger cravings get and the pain of not eating feels almost ecstatic.

Combining it with exercising on an extremely empty stomach is great for shredding my fat but the downside is that it can feel extremely dizzy and it's a dangerous game to play. 

As I write this I know how sick I sound, but I feel so extremely fat all the time and really want to not eat so as to lose weight.",ozrjjw,167,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/ozrjjw/i_enjoy_the_pain_of_hunger/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-08-07 11:25:47

I never lost my period and therefore feel like I don't really have an eating disorder.,"the title pretty much says it.   


  
left and right i see people with uteruses who struggle with anorexia say that they lost their period, are worried about not being able to conceive, or going into recovery just to get it back.   


  
on instagram i see a bunch of wellness and holistic nutritionists talking about ''getting your period back''.  


  
i never lost my period. thanks to the last 7 years with anorexia, i went from mildly overweight to underweight, suffered hairloss and rotting teeth and a burnt esophagus and crippling IBD and colitis.   


  
However, i never missed one period and because of that i feel like i cant really have an eating disorder and be a true anorexic and i feel like i could have recovered by now if it wasnt that im still lowkey hoping to lose my period that way i'll know that I'm truly sick. and i know its stupid and i should be happy i never experienced that but ijsfknsakjdsnkjfd its hard.

Who else feels like anorexia makes their brain totally unable to function academically in addition to emotionally?,"I'm a diligent student, graduating with my BS in psychology (ironic) in May, have a 4.0, and yet I'm struggling and failing to complete my work. It makes me feel like shit because the reason I can't isn't clear. I end up doing crosswords and watching YouTube all day and falling into the reddit rabbit hole.

I feel like I just don't have mental energy, but it seems like such bullshit that I'd be able to do those other mindless activities but can't sit down and write an essay or read abstracts. It isn't just anxiety-procrastinating, which I know I also do. At this point I feel like I physically can't. I just stare at the screen. It makes me hate myself and think I'm just making things up.

I've been weak, cold, and dizzy almost every day, though I am making efforts to eat more. But I can't just tell my professor, sorry, I've been starving myself (with a daily mental breakdown, just to mix it up) so I wasn't able to get my work done. Obviously restriction worsens emotional stuff as well, which includes my OCD and anxiety, and that takes up mental energy to cope with too.

Something people don‚Äôt understand about anorexia,"Everyone‚Äôs ED is different, but overall I have found laypeople often fail to understand that not everyone with anorexia desires to be healthy. I‚Äôd like to say that I do, and to actually mean it. But if we wanted so badly to be healthy, we would ‚Äújust eat‚Äù as people wisely advise me. A girl in my anxiety disorders seminar once said ‚Äúanorexic people know it‚Äôs bad to not eat, so why would they still starve themselves?‚Äú 

I want to be underweight. I think many of us do. The diagnostic criteria for anorexia literally references weight loss. So telling me ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt afford to lose any more weight because then you‚Äôll be unhealthy‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to change anything. In my eating-disordered mind, healthy = fat = bad. 

Recovery is all about gaining the desire to be healthy, to feel healthy. But in the vices of anorexia, I don‚Äôt think any of us are sitting around under any pretenses that what we are doing is conducive to our maximal health. Nobody is like, ‚Äúrestricting/being underweight makes my body function better than it could if it was sufficiently nourished! It helps my mental health so much! 10/10 would recommend feeling like shit every day!‚Äù The nature of this illness is that I want to lose weight, to be underweight, and by definition, that is ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù.

I wish people would stop trying to use the ‚Äúyou know this isn‚Äôt healthy!‚Äù argument because honestly that only encourages and applauds my ED. My advice to those people is to stop assuming that the end goal for the eating disordered mind is health, and trying to handle the conversations as such. Take away healthy/unhealthy references and focus on other aspects beyond physical fitness when trying to help someone who is suffering. 

People assume we all have a survival instinct and a drive to be happy and healthy and to preserve our own lives. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs unfathomable to many why someone would deliberately eat less than they should to be healthy, if the food is available. But if that were the case, then mental illnesses wouldn‚Äôt exist. 

What do you guys think? Do you feel similarly? Have people tried to cure you by telling you that you don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù to lose weight and it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot healthy‚Äù to restrict?",fv93wb,167,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/fv93wb/something_people_dont_understand_about_anorexia/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-04-05 06:11:46

A slap in the face from an unexpected source,"So, I went to rehab last year for a substance abuse disorder. I‚Äôve suffered from co-occurring disorders for years (ED, drug abuse, major anxiety & depression, etc.), so I‚Äôve encountered my fair share of therapists and psychiatrists. I‚Äôve never felt dismissed or shamed by any of my providers... until I went to rehab. Because cocaine is a stimulant and appetite suppressant, it can be extremely harmful when abused by a person struggling with an eating disorder (i.e me). To me, it‚Äôs a very obvious correlation and when my psychiatrist diagnosed me with anorexia it was not a surprise. Anyway, fast forward to the first day in my drug rehabilitation counselor‚Äôs office. We‚Äôre discussing triggers, why I couldn‚Äôt stop using, so my ana diagnosis comes up. ‚ÄúOh‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not right, you‚Äôre not anorexic... people suffering from anorexia are much thinner than you.‚Äù My jaw hit the FLOOR as I sat there in disbelief. All I could do was choke back the tears and anger that this woman, a LICENSED PROFESSIONAL, was not only inaccurate about what the definition of anorexia is, but also brought my biggest fears to life.

Going to inpatient,"Wow. After struggling for almost a decade I'm finally getting help. I'm going to inpatient treatment in a few days and I'm fucking terrified but also fucking ready as I'll ever be. I gave up doing so much that I loved because of ana - I ended my competitive figure skating career, gave up pole vault and cross country because of health issues, skipped out on countless social events and trips because of the food, and even I dropped out of fucking college because I was too sick to even get to class (planning to return after treatment though). I want to have the power back to live my life how I want to but I've also been sick for so long that I don't even know what parts of me are actually *me* and what is ana. I think I'll be in treatment for a while; most places wouldn't even admit me because my BMI is too low and it'll take weeks just to get medically stable. I also have other pretty severe mental health issues and I'd be going to the psych ward right now if I didn't have an ED. I haven't even told my friends or roommates where I'm going, or that I'm even sick, or that I dropped out of school. They'll come back from spring break and I'll be gone with no explanation and we probably won't see each other for months. So yeah. It's been hard to admit to myself how sick I am and that I deserve to be happy and get help but fucking did it and I'm going to fucking recover and get my degree and figure skate again and live my life how I (and all of you reading this) deserve to fucking live it because (say it with me!) I AM WORTHY OF RECOVERY AND I DESERVE HAPPINESS. Wish me luck I guess :)

Update: So I went to treatment. I spent 4 months in inpatient and it was quite the ride. But I made it. And I‚Äôm almost 2 years in recovery! I‚Äôm back in school acing my classes, got an undergrad research position, and am even thinking about grad school. I have so many amazing friends now and a great support system. I even got a cat last year, and she is absolutely the love of my life. None of these things were even options when I was sick. Going to treatment 100% changed my life. I‚Äôm truly living a life I never thought was possible before. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, recovery is a rollercoaster and I have my ups and downs to this day. I still hear ana whispering in my head wanting me to be sick again, and I think she will always be there- but she doesn‚Äôt control me anymore. If you‚Äôre considering going to treatment or getting help in any way, know it will be scary and one of the hardest things you‚Äôll ever do in your life. You‚Äôll step into the hospital and every cell in your body will be begging to leave. But please stay. Treatment truly turned my life around for the better and I am so so thankful to be in recovery.",mgrhm3,161,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/mgrhm3/going_to_inpatient/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-03-30 22:17:35

Currently in Kidney Failure,"Hello friends‚Äî

I‚Äôve been MIA for some time now, both having been in Inpatient and just needing to step away from these communities for a moment. 

I wanted to share with you all that I am currently in kidney failure, and awaiting lab results to determine which stage I am at. I am only 32 years old. There is little hope that I can recover at this point without major medicinal intervention, of which I am not willing to do. I have suffered long enough, and wish to die with my dignity. 

I have suffered for over 25 years with this terrible illness, and I wanted to compassionately warn you all that death by EDs is a VERY REAL THING. I hope this shakes you to your core. I am 32 and dying. It could be within days, or months, but I will die from this. 

I wish you all nothing but healing, and peace. I am terrified. My family is in ruins. I truly cannot believe I am writing this post.

Thank you to every single one of you who has sent me well wishes; I take every word to heart and I have made some beautiful connections here. You are spectacular people, and you deserve full recovery.

Be well, friends ü§ç

ETA: Wow, thank you all for your incredibly kind words of love and support. This is the exact energy we all need, here.

In incredibly surprising news, my lab results are in, and by some chance of all that is good in the world, almost every single value has SHOT up; not just little jumps here and there, like major life-changing amounts. My doctor, family and I are shocked, as I haven‚Äôt changed any behaviors! 

I don‚Äôt know what to make of this; is it a second chance? I have so much thinking to do.

It seems like there are slowly more and more people on here who are asking if they‚Äôre anorexic, posting calorie counts and weight numbers, asking for recommendations on laxatives or supplements, asking about specific safe foods, all of which are clearly stated in the guidelines as not being allowed. Also seeing more people post who make clear that they don‚Äôt have anorexia at all nor are posting about a loved one who does but come on here to ask about fasting or non-related health issues.

Can we talk about how toxic doctors are??,"So I know it‚Äôs their job to inform you about health issues, including those around weight. I get it. But they should at least have some compassion right?

So a few months ago, I found out that if I take too much my thyroid medication, it can cause weight loss. So obviously I started taking more and more each day (I had a reserve because before this I went days without remember to take it.) When I started nearing the end of my stash, I started thinking of lies and ways to get more than my normal dose from my doctor. I realized how terrible I was being and promised myself I would stop and discuss this with my doctor to see what harm I may have done to myself. (It can cause heart issues.) 

During my next doctors appointment, I admitted to abusing the medication and admitted to starving for days and basically broke down and admitted my eating disorder in full. She nodded a lot, gasped a few times and whatnot. A day later, I received an email from her saying I should continue taking medication but in proper dose. And then she told me‚Ä¶ that my cholesterol was high and that I should consider GOING ON A DIET.

3-ish days ago I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/m2jiqh/ordering_pizza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/freedomofit and was like, ""Hell yeah!"" super excited for them. I hadn't eaten yet that week and pizza is one of those foods I love but my ed has taken away from me. I was feeling pretty inspired, as I love to see people doing stuff in recovery that still really scares me. It gives me hope that I could want it for myself one day. I commented on the post, saying I was inspired by it and in one of their replies they said to me,  ""You gotta have some pizza too ü§ó and thanks for your comment ‚ù§"" and it stuck with me so fucking much ü•∫. I continued to not eat until saturday evening, and the logical non-ed part of my brain was panicking that I was just gonna let myself die but then I just thought back to that comment for whatever reason. So I called my best friend and invited them to come over and...

# üçïüçïüçïLAST NIGHT I ORDERED PIZZA TOO!!!! üçïüçïüçï

Guys, I ate pizza with my friend. Hawaiian, extra cheese, thick crust. Don't care what ya'll think about pineapple on pizza, I used to love it. I set myself for success by eating with my best friend who knows about my ED and would make sure I couldn't purge it afterwards. We talked, we laughed, I ATE THE PIZZA, I LET MYSELF ENJOY THE PIZZA!! It was delicious! I loved it. It was a beautiful night out so afterwards we went for a walk and we **GOT ICECREAM**! Ice cream has always been my true love. Like, guys, I was eating and laughing like a normal person and it was so nice üò≠. 

I still don't know if I'm ready for full recovery but this was a huge triumph for me, especially after not eating for almost a whole week and wondering if I was just gonna let myself die. u/freedomofit, if you're reading this I want you to know you really did inspire me, possibly even to save my own life this week.

i dont want to recover because i‚Äôm not underweight,i‚Äôm not underweight and i look perfectly healthy so no one is questioning what i‚Äôm doing. my fear in recovering is that right now i‚Äôm not a concerning weight and i can‚Äôt handle seeing other people who are super skinny being around me while recovering and it‚Äôs not their fault at all obviously. but i‚Äôm just going to be so jealous that when they are out of recovery they are still going to be skinny and when i‚Äôm out of recovery i‚Äôm going to hate how i look. i‚Äôm so worried if i do recover no one is going to take me seriously and look at me like i‚Äôm not meant to be there since i don‚Äôt look like a skeleton. i‚Äôm extremely tired of living my life like this and it‚Äôs not even living i just have such a fear of getting better and can‚Äôt ever see myself not worrying about every single bite of food. i really hope i‚Äôm not alone in this feeling because right now it really does feel like that,kslif8,154,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/kslif8/i_dont_want_to_recover_because_im_not_underweight/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-01-07 20:08:39
Apology,"Recently I made a post with details and numbers about my weight loss & i was asked to take it down because it was triggering. I just wanted to say to anyone that saw my post with specific numbers in it, I am so sorry. I am sorry if i caused a negative thought for even one second, i didn't mean to, and i didn't realize that what i said could have been harmful to someone. My post was only up for a couple hours but to anyone saw it or was triggered or wasn't triggered, I really do apologize. I'm learning the acceptable things to say on this thread, and i now know what not to say. 

I took a moment to weigh myself at work and saw that i was an even ___.0 lbs so i typed a little paragraph real fast and posted it. I should have thought harder about what i had said & I should be able to filter it myself, not have other people tell me what i said was wrong.

does anyone else eat until they feel sick?,like once dinner hits i literally have no control. and i know how i feel after so you would think my body would be like ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs not deal with extreme guilt and feeling horrible for the rest of the night‚Äù but no i eat until i feel sick. like easter dinner i could not stop eating. and it‚Äôs probably because my body just wants food but even if i eat a little during the day i still eat so much food at dinner so in my head i‚Äôm like well if i‚Äôm just gonna binge at dinner eat the smallest amount you can during the day so you don‚Äôt go over your calories. but honestly on most days i‚Äôll eat my regular food which is not enough for a person normally but for me i‚Äôm full but dinner then hits and i binge. i don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs just annoying. does anyone else also have this issue where they just eat until they feel sick no matter what?,mk4xms,149,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/mk4xms/does_anyone_else_eat_until_they_feel_sick/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-04-04 21:08:25

People with EDs are determined and intelligent. We are resilient in that we fight a disorder that is very stigmatized and misunderstood. Unfortunately there is no magic button, but we can use our gifts to fight our illness and reclaim our lives.

Recovery is not linear. Life is not linear. It's okay to fall apart. It's okay to relapse. It's okay to want to give up. But on the other side there is something beautiful waiting for you.

Feed your body to fight your illness instead of feeding your illness to fight your body.

A warning to anyone still restricting,"I‚Äôm in the process of recovering. It‚Äôs still pretty recent, only about a month, but I‚Äôve been noticing changes in my body since I‚Äôve started eating again. This is normal of course, but as I‚Äôm recovering I realized I wasn‚Äôt as unaffected by my restrictive diet as I thought I was. I was eating only once a day for about two years before I went through a three month period of barely eating that lead up to my seeking recovery. I hadn‚Äôt noticed until recently how much hair I was losing when I was restricting. It never came out in clumps, but I got so used to shedding a significant amount of hair that I assumed it was normal and I was fine. I had noticed that my hair was appearing thinner, but I assumed this was a temporary period of hair loss brought on by stress. It wasn‚Äôt until very recently, since eating normally for a few weeks, that I noticed I‚Äôm only losing about a quarter of the hair I had been. Furthermore, just the brief three months of heavily restricting my eating has effectively stopped my period and I‚Äôm still waiting for it; it has been over two months since my last one. The point of this post is to warn everyone still restricting that you might not be as okay as you think you are. I legitimately thought I was fine because I never became under weight and I‚Äôm just realizing that I really did harm my body.

My eating disorder feels more like an addiction rather than an illness,"So basically that, I have other disorders and mental illnesses so I how how they feel, and I've dealt with substance abuse so I know both feelings and my eating disorder Is more an addiction than an illness.

I'm constantly thinking about it, it's the only thing in my head, I'm completely obsessed, my life and everything I do revolves around food and my ED, feeling the hunger pain in my stomach gives me a high and so much serotonin that I crave when I eat and I stop that hunger,, every time I eat I just get anxious and want that pain like it's a fix.

So with all that, the anorexia doesn't feel like other mental illnesses I have (BPD, CPTSD, bipolar etc) I live it like it's a straight up addiction, I crave, I have what I feel when I had withdrawals, I constantly lie and cheat and manipulate, it sounds so stupid but I'm an addict when it comes to anorexia.",11lnkqy,140,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/11lnkqy/my_eating_disorder_feels_more_like_an_addiction/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2023-03-08 05:34:24

Advice on anorexic houseguest?,"Hi, I am looking for some advice here, I have a friend coming to stay for the weekend whom I love dearly. She struggles with anorexia, and just getting her to stay was a huge triumph in itself. I want to make the weekend as comfortable and enjoyable for her as possible. I know she wouldn‚Äôt want to go out to eat, so I will plan activities which don‚Äôt involve food, like a gallery, maybe going to a garden to see some flowers. But my main question is how do i adress the food issue? I need to offer to feed her of course as she is my guest, but I don‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable or like she has to make excuses not to eat/ avoid certain foods. 

So, do I offer to get some of her ‚Äúsafe foods‚Äù (I heard that is a thing)? Or is that going down the wrong path‚Ä¶

When I notice her doing rituals (won‚Äôt mention specificities as not to trigger anyone), should I say anything? 

Basically what can I do to make the weekend as comfortable and safe for her as possible?

"Recovery feels like ""giving up""","\*\*\*Disclaimer: This is NOT a pro-ED post, nor am I trying to discourage anyone from seeking recovery. This is literally just me venting, don't take it too seriously plz lol

So I know logically that recovery is a good thing and something I should want and feel proud of myself for doing. However, it just feels so opposite to everything my mind has been trained to think for so long. Like I hear people saying that recovery takes so much ""strength"" and ""willpower"" and ""dedication"" and ""discipline"" but... these were always characteristics I associated with my eating disorder. Like... I felt like restricting and losing weight meant i was strong; abstaining from ""junk food"" took willpower; going for a run in the rain was dedication; staying under my calorie limit was disciplined. Because it's hard af to actually do those things!! Now you're telling me that what I always thought was ""weak"" and ""lazy"" and ""self-indulgent"" and ""the easy way out,"" such as eating more calories, gaining weight, not exercising everyday, etc is actually what requires hard work and dedication and strength?? But how?! That feels like giving up and being weak, not being strong.

Sometimes this feeling gives me a bit of imposter syndrome about my ED. I tell myself that if I had a ""real"" ED, then I wouldn't feel this way. I feel like a ""fake"" or ""bad"" anorexic. If I was *actually* anorexic, then maybe eating *would* feel more difficult. Idk, I hope this makes any sense :P",mto2dy,135,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/mto2dy/recovery_feels_like_giving_up/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-04-18 23:23:01

List of things that push me into recovery,"I know these times are really hard. Today when I saw I gained weight I felt like I wanted to relapse and not eat anything in weeks. So I'm forcing myself to remember why I want to recover, and share it with you because why not?

1. My hair: I used to have the brightest and healthiest hair and now it is so brittle and bad-looking. I want my hair back.

2. My body hair: This lanugo bs is going to drive me insane. I don't want it anymore.

3. My body shape: I KNOW skinny isn't the answer. I KNOW I don't want to be built like a fucking door. I KNOW I want my tits back. I KNOW I want my ass back. I don't care if some 14 year old with a meanspo blog has written the opposite on Tumblr. Nobody likes bodies that are as severely underweight as mine. And I want to use my old bras again.

4. My mom: I don't want her to suffer anymore because of me.

5. My dad: He likes when I suffer. He laughs when I refuse to eat. When I'm in a bad day, he laughs at my mom because she's suffering. I won't let him win.

6. My future: I want to be an independent adult and if I can't even EAT how the fuck I'm gonna live alone.

7. My social life: I don't want to lose anymore friends because I'm so fucking scared of an ice cream cone that I don't hang out with them.

8. My period: Idgaf if it felt like a knife on my lower back. I miss it. I miss the feeling of ""oh, when I grow up I could have children"" even if I never wanted children.

9. My skin: I have never had porcelain skin. But the mess I have in my face right now is gross. And I have to remember that it was worse when I weighed less.

10. My grades: I still get good grades, but Idk how much I'm gonna be able to keep them high if I need to read 50 times each phrase to fit it in my head because I'm too busy thinking about how could I eat less than xx calories for dinner.

how i almost killed my girlfriend: a confession,"on our first official date we ordered breakfast burritos and ate them in bed, gleefully enjoying a meal together and not caring in the slightest about the cal content. that's how it was at first, happy together sharing plates and finding fun new restaurants...all the while i was severely underweight and struggling, completely entrenched in the eating disorder I've had for nearly a decade. she used to have bulimia nervosa, had it for most of middle and high school, but after becoming homeless around 11th grade she felt too guilty to carry on with her behaviors and had been in recovery for a couple years. 

in the years following her ED she gained some weight, a bit above what was healthy but no more than 5 or so pounds, normal for a teenager with a fluctuating metabolism. she noticed how quickly i lost weight though, how quickly anorexia nervosa can take the life from someone but take the fat from them too, she would support me and i'd talk to her about it but i never wanted to trigger her past disordered behaviors so i was always careful. after some months being together we'd go to a restaurant and share a coke 0 rather than a plate for two, or spend days together not eating at all. 

slowly she started wasting away, becoming completely and utterly consumed with anorexia and restricting/p\*rging. she'd mimic my weight loss behaviors because she knew they worked, i watched her fade away from me just like my friends watched me fade from them. it was the most horrible thing in the world. most horrible thing I've ever witnessed, especially considering i have something called hyper-responsibility OCD, which makes me utterly obsessed with not hurting others or causing them to hurt themselves--to the point where my fear of causing harm consumes me. months went by and her chest and heart hurt constantly, her drug abuse became severe, she fell out of her healthy weight range, and would spend all day either sleeping or on the phone with me crying and begging to die to rid herself of the fat under her skin. the things she said about her body send shivers down my spine, all things i say about myself but hearing my girl recite back to me the horrible things i think about myself was unbearable.

i went in-patient for re-feeding and weight restoration but she just kept getting worse, every day she was with me she got worse. and worse. and worse. every day i feared she wouldn't wake up, i felt like a monster for not only triggering her ED but unknowingly supplying her with numerous maladaptive ""tips and tricks"" so to speak. she broke up with me eventually and immediately started getting better, now she's happy with someone else and at a healthy weight. I'm so happy she's alive and okay, if she hadn't left me I'm sure she would have died and i would have felt like i killed her. 

if this was an isolated incident i might have been able to brush it off (not minimize my impact of course, rather not blaming myself so much) but it wasn't. it happened again with a friend on mine in university, when she saw how fast i lost weight she started eating when i ate (which was rarely) and eventually developed anorexia nervosa, also landing her in an in-patient facility (she is also now in recovery luckily). the damaged I've caused to the people i love is evil and irreparable, and it's hard to not blame my character as opposed to my disorder. it weighs so heavily on me that i try and isolate myself, try and save others from the fate of disordered eating. I've done so successfully for about a year, and as far as im aware this has prevented me from hurting anyone else like this. but now the circumstances have changed and more ED vulnerable people have been introduced into my life. my fear and obsession eats me alive but there is nothing i can do, im well into recovery now (as of today im 5 months sober from p\*rging!!) but i still have many disordered behaviors. EDs have taken so much from me, even if i beat anorexia it feels like it will still kill me nonetheless because of how much i hurt others with my behavior, its made me hate myself more than anything. 

fuck anorexia. fuck disordered eating. fuck them for killing me because even if i recover completely, the damage I've caused because of said disorder has destroyed me. its left me dead with shame, grief, sorrow, anxiety, and fear.",h8ip3d,133,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/h8ip3d/how_i_almost_killed_my_girlfriend_a_confession/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-06-13 23:44:33

Having a visible ED makes not having money REALLY awkward,"I‚Äôm underweight, which I only mention because I think that‚Äôs the reason people act weird about it. I went to an auto shop today because my battery isn‚Äôt working. When he told me how much they cost I cried, which is embarrassing enough. It‚Äôs not as bad as having your card declined on a $3 purchase or something, like plenty of people don‚Äôt just casually have $200! I don‚Äôt even think that reveals me to be low income tbh. He said we could try charging my battery to see if that helps, so I was hanging around the store for about half an hour while it charged. I took off my hoodie and coat because it would be a while and if I get used to inside temperature with them on then I‚Äôm fucked for outside. They offered me a candy bar and I thanked them but politely turned them down. Something that isn‚Äôt strange or sus. 

I could hear them whispering to each other, like ‚Äúwhen do you think was the last time she had a meal?‚Äù 

They thought I was starving. Like, going hungry. 

Super awkward. I wanted to disappear, to disintegrate. To cease to exist. 

They offered me a muffin from like a 4 pack and stressed that if I didn‚Äôt eat it, it‚Äôd be thrown away. I did not want this muffin, but it felt like it‚Äôd be selfish to turn it down. They were trying to be so nice, and I‚Äôm out here misleading people just by existing in my body. I feel so guilty and horrible. 

My finances are basically nonexistent right now, but they didn‚Äôt even know that. They just knew I didn‚Äôt have $200 and look like this.

This isn‚Äôt the first time people have come to that assumption, like people offer to buy my groceries for me kind of a lot if they see me checking out, especially if they see me change my mind about something. I don‚Äôt let them, it just feels so wrong. But this was the worst it‚Äôs ever been, I think because I heard them mention my weight/body. I don‚Äôt normally have such blatant confirmation, like usually I can try to think that maybe I‚Äôm reading too much into something even though I don‚Äôt believe that.

So I‚Äôve been seeing another doctor that I‚Äôm familiar with and today was the most humiliating experience of my life. He spent a good 30 minutes telling me that I‚Äôm a woman and I need to have curves and shouldn‚Äôt look like a boy. That I‚Äôm meant to have more fat and my body is meant to be supple. That I need to use logic and not lose anymore weight because my boyfriend won‚Äôt be attracted to me if I do.

I don‚Äôt have significant body issues. I think I just want to be sick/dead.,"I do have body issues. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really why I have anorexia. 

I think I just want to die. Have a heart attack or organ failure. Maybe I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll end up on life support or something and come back from it and suddenly want to live. At my best I‚Äôm just sort of putting off suicide a few more years instead of thinking of it as an immediate option. At my worst I end up back in the hospital for suicidal ideation and whatnot. Ideation. I hate myself for being all talk and no bite. Like a failure because I haven‚Äôt -actually- tried to kill myself. 

I feel like such a piece of shit. Worthless. Pointless. A fraud. I have this amazing job in which I help people with mental health issues, and I‚Äôm a fraud. I keep feeling like an imposter and my dietician recently pointed out that I kind of am. I‚Äôm helping people and encouraging them to get better, while in secret, I‚Äôm making myself worse. Diet pills. Psyllium husk. Lying about having eaten. I live alone so it‚Äôs pretty easy to get away with it. Is anorexia a choice? What does that say about me, that I‚Äôm choosing sickness? Attention-seeking? I realized this week that I‚Äôve struggled to eat for five years. Most of that was very secretive. Now this year I told people and am diagnosed with anorexia. And I love that. My fucked up twisted brain. 

My dietician said this week that my ‚ÄúED voice‚Äù is louder and more intrusive and stubborn than anybody else she works with. And I was PROUD of that. Fuck. Me. I must be a real piece of shit. 

And yet, I‚Äôm nowhere near the weight I want to be. Know I could be at. My BMI is still in the green, at least for a few more pounds. I‚Äôve seen the signs of sickness in me when it wasn‚Äôt. People asking, ‚ÄúHey... aren‚Äôt you looking kinda skinny?‚Äù My hair falling out in handfuls, my tightest pants requiring a belt. Then I started eating more and my hair stopped falling out after some time. And guess what? I‚Äôm upset about that. It‚Äôs not a sign of progress. ‚ÄúProgress.‚Äù 

Anyways. I just feel sad and weak and like a piece of shit. The reality is that I just want to be sick. I don‚Äôt want to get better. I tell my dietician every week. I tell her I‚Äôm wasting her time. Wasting my time. But I think I like the self-pity-party. Watch me burn, ya‚Äôll.

It‚Äôs been a year since I got over the worst of my eating disorder. Recently it hit me that I still bear resentment towards my friends/ family for never noticing (+ my life story I guess),"Or perhaps even against humanity in general. Or maybe, I‚Äôm just frustrated that emotional pain is reserved to the individual. No one ever knows how you truly feel or how deeply you are hurt. 

I‚Äôve been depressed for the majority of my life. Once I got out of it I went straight back in with an eating disorder on top of it, no one ever reached out to me, or comforted me when I needed it the most. I was below essential fat%, looking back on pictures I was visibly very sick.
After I recovered a friend told me they and everyone else noticed but just didn‚Äôt say anything. It lasted over a year, and no one ever reached out. 

It felt like it was all in my head, the part of me that still wanted to live thought that surely someone would say something or stop me before I would drop dead. I got worse, and worse. My heartbeat started hitting the lower 30‚Äôs, I‚Äôd go to sleep every night terrified I wouldn‚Äôt wake up. Just laying down on my side would bruise my knees, I had red marks on my inner thighs from repeatedly burning them with a rubber flask filled with hot water to keep myself warm. (Went to the doctor with it, he said I might need laser treatment but luckily it faded) To this day, after making a near full recovery I still throw up randomly sometimes and have chronic hiccups that can get very painful. The worst part of it being the near constant reminder  that I did something my body can‚Äôt forgive

I have a history of mental illness, my parents both knew that. My friends all knew that. I simply can‚Äôt comprehend why no one reached out, no one attempted to talk some sense into me or show compassion. It was just me. Even looking back now with my life together, it is absurd that there never once was anyone despite me occasionally reaching out myself. 

On a winter day during the bike home from school I simply broke down. Somewhere something in me realized I wasn‚Äôt going to be saved by anyone, it was like a survival instinct almost. The next month felt like one big reflex, I started exercising like crazy and eating much more. If only I could tell you I magically regained my senses and got better but sadly not. I went from anorexia to bulimia, both through excessive exercise and puking and lost even more weight. 

My stepdad would mock me for eating so much, 
I would make half a salad bowl full of oatmeal after school and hide in the bathroom to eat it, that went on for weeks. Honestly it felt like the world just wanted me dead. It felt like apart of me wanted me dead. Writing about this feels absurd, I haven‚Äôt thought about this for so long. I‚Äôm quite disassociated from this entire chapter of my life, it almost doesn‚Äôt even feel like my story anymore 

After half a year of bulimia I became ecstatic about slowly regaining my strength. I did a lot of weight training and track sports, I slowly eased into allowing myself to eat more but would still throw up if I ate anything unhealthy. Over the course of a few months I slowly got better, and eventually got where I am today. 

I‚Äôve been running from acknowledging this part of me for awhile now. To this day I haven‚Äôt spoken about it with my parents, despite my bond with them having improved significantly. Only 2 of my friends know the gist of it, and I don‚Äôt see them often. 

It feels scary now that i could be so horrible to myself, and even endanger my own wellbeing to that extent. I wish someone would have cared, I wish I would‚Äôve had a shoulder to cry on, or someone to slap some sense into me. 
This could have meant the end for me, it feels horrible that in the end I could only rely on myself, even when I felt I had lost myself, and for that I honestly still hold a grudge. 

Not much that can be done there I suppose. I do know that I want to remember this pain in order to be compassionate towards others where others have failed me. No one should have to face a darkness like that by themselves. One act of kindness would have changed my world, I can‚Äôt conceal that this experience turnt me bitter, however hopefully it will also lead me to an act of kindness that might change someone else‚Äôs world for the better",mx8gbq,128,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/mx8gbq/its_been_a_year_since_i_got_over_the_worst_of_my/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-04-24 00:03:13

i got out of the hospital and no one cared,"hi... i don‚Äôt know if anyone will actually read this, but i need to get this off my chest. i am absolutely devastated, and i know it may sound like i‚Äôm exaggerating, but i genuinely feel like sadness is eating me up alive. i got into a hospital because of anorexia a few months ago, and before getting admitted in the hospital i wrote a few texts to the only people i talk to (which are all online friends bc i don‚Äôt have any friends in real life) to let them know i would be gone for a bit. i got discharged recently and when i texted those people to let them know i was back from the hospital, one of them didn‚Äôt even ask how i was doing. the other just said they were sorry because my recovery wasn‚Äôt going well, then they changed the topic of the conversation. another person didn‚Äôt care at all and now they reply to my texts once every 2 days if i‚Äôm lucky.
this has me wondering... what if i just die? what‚Äôs there to lose anyways? the only people i expected to care, or to at least write me a few words of encouragement, absolutely don‚Äôt give a shit about me.  yes, they might be online friends, but i have known them for at least 1 year. after years spent talking, you‚Äôd expect someone to be a little interested in your well-being. 
that didn‚Äôt happen.
not to mention the fact that my family doesn‚Äôt understand me, so i have no one to fight for, not even myself.

Anorexia is not just about body image,"Look, I see myself as beautiful. I never developed anorexia because of my physical appearance. I developed anorexia because it terrified me to watch a loved ones' health decline due to weight gain.

ANOREXIA IS NOT JUST SELF ESTEEM BASED.

I'm much more focused on my health than most people (My psychologist said that anyhow), and I'm so afraid of my health deteriorating due to being fat. Nobody understands that I don't have issues with my body image, I've learned to love and embrace my insecurities. Nobody understands that I have anorexia out of fear. I'm not anorexic because I want others to see me as beautiful, I'm anorexic because I'm so overly concious of my health that it fucked up my thought process.

I mean, I get it, a lot of 14yo's have self esteem issues, but you can't just assume that these issues are because of that. It hurts more and more to be told I'm beautiful how I am, it just makes me feel like looks are more important than anything else.

When it becomes more about the number on the scale rather than how thin you look,"I've been in recovery for some time and decided to take on weight lifting. I thought heck, why not, if I'm gonna gain weight I better gain some muscle and become strong.

Well I'm five months into lifting and I've been pretty satisfied with myself. I look leaner, more muscle definition and less ""fat"".

I weighed myself yesterday after avoiding it and I saw that I had gained weight. Don't know why I was expecting myself to be less heavy. Severely restricted and didn't exercise yesterday, because I was so scared (also I was injured).

Today has been tough, assimilating the thought  of me being heavier hasn't been easy at all. 'Health' has always been a bad word to me because I associate it to becoming 'fatter' though I know it's not, but I'm not giving up.

And to anyone reading this and struggling, remember, the number on the scale doesn't equal your value. It isn't how you should measure your self-worth. Gaining weight isn't bad. Being healthy isn't bad.

Bridesmaid Dress Shopping,"TW: mention of size/body dysmorphia

Today was the day I have been dreading for months, praying for the lockdown to go on so I wouldn‚Äôt have to go dress shopping. But today came anyways, and I‚Äôm left with a feeling of both pride and absolute shame. 

My best friend is getting married and I am one of 4 girls in the bridal party, and we are all very different shapes and sizes. We had 5 styles to choose from, and I got left with the spaghetti strap option. 

There are no mirrors in the changing rooms so you have to go out in order to even see what it looks like. So I try on the dress in a sample size, the same size I wore to my sisters wedding last year, I walk out and realize it is about four sizes too big. Our consultant comes over and immediately clips me into it so it doesn‚Äôt fall down and proceeds to measure me to find out what size I am....and it ended up being the smallest size they offer. 

I tried to joke about needing a bigger push up bra to fill out the dress, but I didn‚Äôt feel the rush pride I once would have. Instead I am filled with feelings of shame and embarrassment. Ashamed that I let myself get to this point, embarrassed that I thought I could stop at any time, and now anorexia is controlling my life. 

I think I caught a glimpse of myself through someone else‚Äôs eyes, just for a second, when I turned around I saw a woman in a child‚Äôs body. I could see stares from other bridal parties, and whispers back and forth from mother to daughter. I have become the cautionary tale parents tell their children, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to end up like her‚Äù.

Today was the day I realized, I am way further down this rabbit hole than I ever thought.",m4kcb8,122,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/m4kcb8/bridesmaid_dress_shopping/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-03-14 01:11:11

I'm not hating on these people by any means, but they tend to be young teenage girls and I'm not sure how great a grasp they have of their influence - their actions, words, behaviours etc. have a huge influence on the way other sufferers view and manage their own recoveries and relapses.

Can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm fat or thin anymore,"A part of me thinks I‚Äôm getting thinner like I want and a part of me doesn‚Äôt. I know I‚Äôve lost weight but I don‚Äôt want to weigh myself because I feel like I‚Äôll be upset no matter how much weight I‚Äôve lost/haven‚Äôt lost. I just want to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again and lose weight the healthy way but I feel like I‚Äôll never be able to get back to that mindset. I‚Äôm at a healthy weight right now but for some reason I can‚Äôt stop with all the negative self-talk and seeing myself as fat. 

This is going to sound so bad, and it might possibly be triggering, so fair warning: 

I know I‚Äôm an attractive person. Not because that‚Äôs what I think, but because I see how others react to me. I get hit on a lot and will notice when others check me out in public. I‚Äôve had many boyfriends and girlfriends (I‚Äôm bisexual) and I have a natural hourglass figure; small waist, big butt, big boobs. My current boyfriend worships me and always gives me compliments on my appearance (as well as other things) and that reassures me. I‚Äôm just so confused; If other people think I‚Äôm ‚Äúhot‚Äù the way I am now, why do I only see myself as this fat and undesirable person?

I just want to be at a lower weight, but a part of me feels like I‚Äôll never be satisfied and I‚Äôll always come up with a new ‚Äúlow‚Äù once I reach the old one, if that makes sense. 

I think one of the reasons I can‚Äôt stop starving myself is because I am absolutely terrified of gaining weight. A couple years ago I was at my highest, and most unhealthy, weight and I was able to lose it all and then some, and I‚Äôve realized that my biggest fear is gaining it all back. The thought of getting bigger terrifies me and I‚Äôm not happy with how I look now so the only solution in my mind is to get smaller. 

If you took the time to read this, and maybe you feel some of the same things I do, know that you‚Äôre not alone. Our situations we‚Äôre in truly suck and we don‚Äôt deserve it, but I‚Äôm hoping we will get through it together. :,)",gpa4rr,124,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/gpa4rr/cant_tell_if_im_fat_or_thin_anymore/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-05-23 18:40:27

What the hell even is my life,"So... since the last time I posted, so much has happened. My parents were in a horrible car wreck, my dad was okay. My mom... she was DOA, but they were able to revive her. He heart stopped multiple times, she has horrible crush injuries to her chest, she needed ten lifesaving surgeries. And after a month in the icu, she came home and I became her primary care giver, nurse, if you will. 

Point being I'm utterly traumatized. When I first went to visit my parents in June, I was XXX lbs, I am now XX lbs. 

I came back to florida, bc it was obvious that I was killing myself trying to take care of my mom- working myself to the bone, apparently.

I saw my old therapist yesterday, she was my therapist in my treatment center but recently went into private practice.

Everyone, neighbors, friends, random acquaintances, all see me and ask me if I'm okay. If I've eaten. Should I really be taking my dog on 3 mile walks with my weight like this? 

Like... how is it any of your business? No, my mom died multiple times and I then spent months cleaning her wounds, bathing her,  checking her pulse-ox, her heart monitor, watching her cough up blood... SO NO IM NOT OKAY. 

My therapist yesterday put stipulations on us continuing to work with eachothera mainly because two nights ago I ended up in the hospital because I fainted and am severely underweight for my height and I now have a concussion. 

Her stipulations are EDA meetings, and scheduling a time everyday to let myself feel- to embrace the flashbacks and the pain and guilt I feel over not being strong enough for my mom to be able to stay. 

And that's fine... but it's not. Because even though everyone I see tells me they're worried about me, when I look in the mirror I just see fat, I don't see this skin and bones thing everyone's talking about. 

Im terrified of gaining weight, but I know I need to do it, but... the thought makes me cry.",j4h6vp,123,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/j4h6vp/what_the_hell_even_is_my_life/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-10-03 15:44:07

New Point of View,"My eating disorder started out of a desire to have control over something in my life.  I was in charge of what I ate and how much I ate.

My body dysmorphia is different to others,"You see, I never saw myself really fat, but I always thought I looked a healthy weight, not really knowing how skinny I actually looked. Looking back at photos, if I saw myself like that I would've stopped. I genuinely thought I was healthy weight.  Also I had a virtue to not feel any looseness in my body as I misinterpreted that as fat, not loose skin. As a result I had hospitalised myself. Now as a CrossFit trainee I have realised that I can be healthy without starving myself and healthy is eating more than I was. The changes to my body were incredible. I saw my muscles coming back and I was no longer a young boy to feel sorry for. I was a man. I looked taller, more muscular and ever since CrossFit I am defeatinf anorexia. Who knew? I really wish that you guys take this and be less fearful of gaining weight. Yes some differences are noticeable, but these are good differences that make you look and feel so much better. You won't ever get fat, in fact you'll still look thin. Trust me from experience, don't let anorexia shroud you in fear.",iyxz0t,117,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/iyxz0t/my_body_dysmorphia_is_different_to_others/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-09-24 14:11:05

I feel bad for being happy that I weigh less than my younger sister,"For context my family went on a trip a while ago and we did a lot of swimming in the lake. My 3 siblings and I wanted to climb on each others shoulders and try to knock each other into the water, just typical fun stuff. I then discovered now all of my siblings, who are younger than me, could lift me up. Even the youngest who is tiny could lift me. My siblings were surprised too, and we all started comparing weights. I found out that I was smaller in weight to my brother and my sister. My brother is taller than me, so that wasn't too much of a surprise that he weighed more, but my sister is around my height. I felt delighted immediately, then I felt sick to my stomach. What is wrong with me? Feeling happy that I weigh less than my siblings? That's disgusting.

"Does anyone else feel like if you just starve themselves, eventually you'll be happy?","When I was underweight, I wasn't happy because I looked like a sickly stick. I was simultaneously ""too fat"" in my own mind, while being too skinny because I still wanted to have boobs and a butt.

Craving and hating food at the same time?,"Like the title goes I crave and hate the food in the same time. Anyone here with the same or similar situation? The situation is so ambivalent.

I don't want to be fat ever again. I would rather die thin and emaciated than to be fat and have a large fat stomach and butt. By the way, I am male, 26 years old if that means anything.

Also, people are scared of me. They say that I now look like a skeleton. My hair is falling out, I did not have an erection for months now. Sexual drive is not there anymore. Oh and the thirst. I don't feel the thirst. All the water that I take in comes from my single meal - apples. Thank you Universe for the apples. Only three apples a day and that is all. No other food.

I lie when someone asks do I eat. Plus hypotension. When I get up from a chair or a couch I get dizzy and blackness covers my eyes. I hit my head once like that. Almost died. Awful. But yet again I want to stay like this. I count every single calorie, I weigh myself every few days, write down food that I ate even if that food was just like I said - apples.

As we are a support subreddit, we do not feel comfortable, morally, going dark. Going private for 48h would deprive our users of the emotional support this comnunity offers, overall being detrimental to many. A protest isn't worth the mental health of our community members. 

Hypothetically, we could close the subreddit and open the Discord. However, I am the one working on the Discord server. I have been on vacation the past week and have been unable to make progress on it in that time, and still have much to do. While it will probably be open by the 12th, I do not want to push myself when I have things to do offline during that time. 

However, we fully support the communities that *are* going dark, and can only hope that Reddit listens to us and comes to understand that their decisions are detrimental to the Reddit communtiy as a whole. 

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to either comment them under this post or to modmail them to the subreddit.

The other day she sat me down and told me she knows I‚Äôve lost weight and she found my scales in my wardrobe. She then told me that my board will increase and that I now have to pay for my own food. She then went into detail about ‚Äúhow much smaller‚Äù she was when she was my age and that she could only eat 1 slice of pizza per day before she got so full she felt sick.

Unfortunately this just caused me to relapsed, i want to move out by the end of the year but I don‚Äôt know but I just can‚Äôt take her comments anymore, and I don‚Äôt know how to tell her to stop, I‚Äôve tried in the past but nothing gets through.",p13yml,112,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/p13yml/my_mother_is_making_my_ed_worse/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-08-09 15:40:57
"Uh yeah, I'm 'better' now, thanks for asking","So I had to go off work sick about a week ago. I had a mental health crisis, spiralled like crazy, and it kicked off the biggest relapse I've had in years. Planning my meals and counting calories and focusing on food is about the only thing keeping me sane right now. 

I'm back at work today and of course everyone is asking if I feel better now (they don't know why I went off, or if they do it wasn't because I told them) and it's just...no I'm not all better. I'm still a mess, I'm technically sicker than I was before because now I'm relapsing. I'm just more in control and a bit calmer. That doesn't mean I'm not still sick. 

Only had a couple people ask so far, but I work in a big team and I can't hide from them all day, and I know I'm going to have to lie through my teeth because I can't have them know I'm x number of calories away from mcfreaking losing it any time they ask.

This disorder is so isolating,"It‚Äôs like a cult leader that convinces you to stay faithful by turning down dinner with friends, staying in your room alone when your parents make you food, missing out on networking opportunities bc the work event has appetizers, and even when you do decide to socialize you have this voice screaming in your head the whole time about ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat that‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a pig, you‚Äôre weak if you eat that‚Äù and it keeps you from making a genuine connection with anyone.

We got this thing called the half baked with Oreo and Monster cookie dough thats been lol well halfway baked and with ice cream scoop on top. My friends were great and didn't comment (they know praise for eating makes me think I binged) when I ate the whole thing basically by myself and OMG it was delicious! It was warm and a cookie but also soft dough with oreos and peanut butter and M&Ms and the cold ice cream was perfect. I didn't even get mad when they drizzled it with chocolate sauce beforehand. It was just really nice to appreciate food for the flavor/ temperature / texture and I didn't feel the need to use my app to calculate the calories afterwords or purge it. My regular patterns resumed the next day but i keep thinking back to that meal and reliving it when I'm hungry and instead of being ashamed I'm really proud of myself for it.

My family gets mad that I always try to look for the expiration date on food. And I refuse to eat food that has been in room temperature past the recommended time...,"Long vent: 
They always leave food that has to be refrigerated out. 
And they use expired food in their cooking. I know it‚Äôs technically safe to eat food after the best before date but I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about it if I do eat something after the expired date. 
Everyone gets so angry and yells at me, telling me things like ‚Äúwell you‚Äôve lived this long with my cooking and you‚Äôre not dead yet!‚Äù

They also microwave non safe microwave plastic and styrofoam plates. I tell them they shouldn‚Äôt do that but they do it anyway. 
They reuse plastic bottles for water, which I think we‚Äôre supposed to use the bpa safe containers. But if I tell them that they won‚Äôt listen. 
The water they bring from the store just doesn‚Äôt taste right either; it leaves you with a dry mouth. 

They also eat all of the food and leave me with nothing. My youngest sister is the worst. My mom bought a family chip sized bag and she‚Äôs already scarfing it down. She never leaves me any snacks to eat because they‚Äôre always gone in a day. 
I love this place but I can‚Äôt wait to be on my own as eat at my own pace with food that have been properly cleaned of and taken care of. 

Even the eggs are expired now something I usually eat, and the bread smells too sour. 
Whenever there‚Äôs nothing to eat I make an egg sandwich with mayo.

Chronic EDs,"EDs feel sexy at first- they are forbidden and mysterious, with the promise of some prize if you keep going further into it. Even when you first start recovery, or first relapse, there are a lot of people there helping you fight. But if it becomes chronic, and as you get older, you become frozen in time. People move on, get married, and have kids and families. You are stuck with a debilitating, dangerous disease that is no longer sexy or seductive at all- it's the worst kind of boring, but just as life-threatening. I think this is the least discussed long term consequence- that you just stay stuck in your ED until it is embedded into your personality.

Apparently all I have to do is eat. I'm cured!,"So, I just read something to my boyfriend, the man who is supposed to love me. It was a blog post I wrote about how scary it is to see physical changes in my body from anorexia and having to accept this could kill me. I poured my fucking heart out. I asked him numerous times if he was sure he wanted me to read it before I hesitantly did.
What I got in return was my boyfriend literally screaming at me, telling me that ""all I need to do is eat!"" Not a gentle prodding, but a screaming at the top of his lungs, ""you're just making excuses"" and ""you're not trying because you think you need professional help to get better when all you need to do is eat!"" When I said I needed support and I had nobody to help me, he proceeded to scream at me more, telling me he's ""tried it my way for months and I've only gotten worse"" and that what I need is to be ""forced to eat, forced to get better."" Then he threatened to commit me. So, that was awesome. Am I wrong here? I told him he can't fix this. He refuses to believe that. But then when his approach doesn't work, it's my fault. I get that he's scared because he loves me and doesn't want me to die, but this only pushes me away more and makes me want to eat even less. Not to mention, when I eat something that was really hard for me, he doesn't get that. He just says I need to eat more than that. How do I deal with this? Any tips?

Even if just for today...,"Okay... Today, I had a high fever and my whole body, joints and all, felt like it was going to break. I had a bad headache, couldn't look at lights, had ringing in my ears, and the cherry on top was my stomach. It was in so much pain, literally could feel indigested food roll around in it and cause severe stabbing pains. I was so lightheaded and detached I could barely walk. 

But later on in the day, with the help of medications and subtle self-care, my body fought off the fever and... ü•∫ 

Ugh I'm gonna cry. 

My joints are so much better, my stomach is kinda still in pain but waaaay better than this morning, I'm no longer lightheaded and I overall feel great now that the fever is gone. 

So it dawned on me... 

My body, single-handedly pulled through. It fought off the sickness and took care of the pain, all on its own. 

Though yes, I'm still on my bullshit and weight loss is still my one main goal, but something clicked in my mind even if only for today. 

I will listen to my body's cravings. Just for today, I will eat what it's been craving for days now. Just for today, I'll reward it for what it's done for me. Just for today, I'll have it eat as much as it wants till it feels satisfied.

"My wife is deep in a relapse and we have no options, I don't know how to stay sane and support her. I just want her to have the help she deserves.","My wife is anorexic, and I try very hard to be as supportive and encouraging as I can. She is relapsing extremely bad and she has no health insurance and though she's in therapy, the therapist has absolutely no experience with Eds. I try so hard to listen, and support, and be a positive influence when I'm able. I always remember that she is the one going through this, not me. 

But y'all, I am fucking terrified. Last year my wife had a very similar pattern of relapse which ended in inpatient treatment and medical stabilization, but now that is not an option as far as I can tell. 

She has this awful voice inside her, a monster and it's becoming so vocal that sometimes when we talk I can see that her eating disorder is talking to me, not her. The coldness and hatred of herself is so loud and clear and it breaks my heart. I tell her every day in every way how wonderful and kind and good and worthy she is of love and of food. That she doesn't deserve to suffer.

I knew when we started dating, hell I knew when I was even CONSIDERING dating her that there was a chance she could die... And I accepted that risk, and I still do.

I love her and I don't want to see her in pain, and I don't want to watch helplessly.

I drank naked high protein drinks, full fat yogurts, peanut butter, eggs, etc. I am now 100 lbs and love how I look and feel. Being 5'3, my healthy BMI states my weight should be 107 so I still have some weight to gain. But boy, do I feel soooo much better! I've been struggling with this disease more than half of my life. Thankfully I always knew how skinny I looked, I just didn't know how to ""fix"" it. There was no therapy, no meds to reach my goals. I just promised myself to eat a certain amount of calories each day (like 2500-3000.) Sometimes it's hard to do the opposite of what 90 percent of the population is doing (trying to lose weight,) but us skinny people need to be supported as well!

Psychology degree means nothing if you do more harm than good,"I was in psychology class in my collage, (collage specially for psychology and similar) when teacher started telling hurtful comments about anorexia and bulimia. I won't tell all of it but one of the comments was ""I onice saw anorexic girl, she was just bones and skin and she was so ugly"". At this point I started getting triggered but I managed to stay silent UNTIL he said comment about need to have certain body to be considered anorexic. I snaped at that moment and started arguing with him. I told him that anorexia is mental illness and had nothing to do with being too skinny. You can be too skinny because of other illnesses like any type of cancer patients can end up being extremely skinny. And he had audacity to say ""so you're telling me fat people can have anorexia?"" and on top of that, whole class started laughing. But I didn't gave up, I continue with my arguing but he didn't even want to listen and just said ""Okay I don't know those medical words and I don't care"". 

THAT SAME PEOPLE ARE TEACHERS. That person is teaching whole class that you have to look like you're dying if you want diagnosis and that you don't deserve one if you're anything by that. 

I had many stories about psychologists and psychiatric doing something so unprofessional that made me not want to go and seek help ever again. One of them told me I'm lazy waste of space for having depression. 15 minutes after that I wanted to kill myself in the hospital bathroom.

My recovery so far,"Hi, I used to be overweight in my teens, so I started to lose weight, but I wasn't really informed on how to do it correctly, and that led me to an eating disorder.

TRIGGER WARNING ‚Äî- Today a 59 year old woman told me she‚Äôs starving herself to lose weight,"Okay so I honestly need to be 100% transparent about this situation in order to be truthful to myself and the people on this subreddit. 

I was working on a job today with this Woman who not only was trying to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù how I was able to stay so thin ( I struggle with anorexia and i am one of the ‚Äústereotypical versions of anorexia that has an extremely low weight ‚Äî though I am completely aware that ANYONE of ANY weight can struggle with anorexia !! This is a misconception we NEED to dismantle so everyone of all backgrounds can get treated properly!!!) Anyways, this 59 year old woman I was working with  not only asked me if I‚Äôm on a stick diet (where I lied and said ‚Äúno, I don‚Äôt believe in diet culture‚Äù- which I DONT, but I‚Äôm stuggling with anorexia so It really contradicts that belief. But tbh as someone with an eating disorder I feel like it‚Äôs EVEN MORE clear how toxic diet culture is, thereby reinforcing how much I DONT support it. Any ways, she told me she was INTENTIONALLY starving herself And only drinking protein shakes because being ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù is bad for your organs. After educating myself SO MUCH on fatphobia, eating disorders, and diet culture, it was shocking but also no so shocking to hear this coming from a 59 year old. I don‚Äôt mean this in a judge mental way, i was just genuinely shocked at the ignorance this woman had and the evident lack of confidence it was inflicting upon her- even at 59 years old. Look, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm struggling with anorexia. But deep down i believe  that health at every size is REAL. Even if I can‚Äôt come to terms with it within my own body. I really don‚Äôt mean to judge this woman because I know the struggle; but as a young person it‚Äôs Lowkey terrifying to see that there are middle age/ older people actively struggling with disordered eating. To anyone stifling with disordered eating, especially those in the higher numbers of age , you are BEAUTIFUL. You DONT need to change your body . HEALTH AT EVERY SIZE IS DEADASS REAL. DONT LET DIET CULTURE INFLUENCE YOUR LIFE, you CAN ALWAYS MAKE THAT CHANGE. MUCH LOVE‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT: okay I didn‚Äôt realize this would get so many upvotes but I just want to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, commented, and shared your thoughts and experience. My aim of this was to share an experience I had that was a bit triggering but eye opening nonetheless. I really hope this post was able to amplify an area of ED that is often overlooked. Someone in the comments brought up a really good point: that eating disorders are also really about finding and obtaining a sense of control in life. So true. I hope we can all find healthier ways to find that sense of control in our lives. I hope we can all heal one day- but the path to healing is an everyday thing. Baby steps my friends, baby steps. And LET IT BE KNOWN - no matter your age, your size, your background, or any other factor ‚Äî you can still struggle from an ED. YOU ARE VALID. You can be ANY weight, ANY age, and from ANY background and deal with this shit. Don‚Äôt let society tell you your struggles are not valid because of some BULLSHIT standard. Everyone deserves to be recognized. Everyone deserves support and a chance to recover.

A Disorder of Privelege?,"Someone close to me said something the other day that had me wondering if I was just being selfish by having anorexia. He said that someone who grew up poor or worrying about where their next meal was coming from would never starve themselves, and that young white girls are anorexic because they want to look like celebrities, which comes from privilege. I grew up in an upper middle class, white family, in the suburbs of Long Island. I never wanted for anything. We weren't wealthy, but all my needs were covered, we went on vacations, Christmas brought tons of gifts, and I never worried about having food or clothing or a place to sleep at night. I developed an eating disorder in adolescence out of a need for perfectionism and control. I was the overachiever, the one who was expected to go to college and be ""successful."" I started dieting because I wanted to be thinner, which is an ideal born from privilege. This developed into anorexia, due to genetic and environmental factors combining into a ""perfect storm"" of sorts. I keep feeling like I'm just vain, even though I know eating disorders are real, serious mental disorders. I keep thinking that if I wasn't so privileged growing up, I wouldn't have anorexia, and by not eating, I'm being shallow.
I've researched eating disorders and know they don't discriminate, and I know they're not about food or weight. But I keep wondering if, when it comes to anorexia specifically, the cause is partially socioeconomic. I feel like a petty person, and yet, this doesn't solve my problem. I still have this disorder. I'm still unable to eat. I live paycheck to paycheck now and I'm in my 30s. This person close to me can't be right, can they? And if they are, what does that say about me? How do all of you feel about this statement?

But now its stopped. I cant lose weight doing this anymore. So the only next step is to eat nothing. And I know I can do it. But I dont want to fully go into that but prom is coming up in a few months and I dont want to look like a whale in that dress.

"Uncomfortable when people use ""ana"" instead of anorexia","I really don't know what the point of me posting this is, but I'll proceed anyway (also, I'm not referring to any single post or anything like that).

I get really uncomfortable when people talk about their disorder and not actually say ""anorexia"", but use ""ana"" instead.

For me ""ana"" is only used in proana forums/situations/whatever and it makes me so damn uncomfortable when others use it synonymously with anorexia.

I've been a victim of proana forums and seeing people saying shit like ""ana tells me x"" or whatever just triggers somethings inside me, I don't know what.

I. Gained. Weight.,"So .. I hit a low weight about a week and a half ago . Then Easter holiday happened. And I decided to eat 'normally' so my parents wouldn't bring up my eating with my therapist.. However 'normal' turned into binging and purging a lot of the day , and I've been so tired I haven't even been purging the past few days .

I gained . I'm notably bigger. Not much. But I am. And of course to me it's a HUGE DEAL .

But someone I know in school REGULARLY body-checks me (wrapping his hands around my wrist , picking me up to feel my weight.. No he's not my boyfriend. He's just creepy) and I KNOW he will comment on my weight gain . And I am terrified.

Wearing baggy clothes is fine for everyone else . But I know he will pick me up at some point. AND HE WILL SAY "" YOU ARE HEAVIER !"" .

I am scared to go back to school. Because of him.  


Edit : Okay I got more replies than I thought . And I didn't really think of this as assault before but I guess you're right ;-; I don't really want to report him because he's the only person who actually wants to hang around me in school .

My weird AN side effect.,"This is a niche (and kinda gross) side effect my Eating Disorder caused me.

When my ED was in it‚Äôs peak, I struggled to sleep due to stomach pains from hunger. I solved this by drinking excessive amount of water an hour before I‚Äôd sleep to ‚Äúfill me up‚Äù. Thing is, I was drinking so much that I needed to pee a lot. (i was drinking litres and litres). I would get to a point where I couldn‚Äôt physically pee but oils literally feel urine sloshing inside of me, that I just couldn‚Äôt pee out. This feeling screwed up my sleep, the entire thing I was trying to fix, however i eventually discovered that by put pressure on my urethral opening (place where pee comes out for those who don‚Äôt know) I could make myself pee. I was a germaphobe and I hated it but I did it every night for two years. My urine was mostly water since I drank so much but it still grossed me out. Anyway, fast forward to now. I‚Äôm in recovery. Except due to the urethra thing, I stretched out the opening with my finger, which makes me pee in small amounts without being able to control it, similar to the way a woman does after giving birth (completely different causes, same volume and timing).

Just a thought...,"ED is like a teacher and I'm a student: hear me out: 

When you're in class and doing sooooo good at a certain subject, the teacher appreciates all your efforts, keeps complimenting you, and encourages you to keep going. 

So what do you do? You push yourself harder because you don't want to let the teacher down. You're so used to being excellent in that subject, especially in your teacher's eyes, that you can't really bring yourself to lack. 

That's how it is. That's especially why most of us just can't stop. 

ED is a teacher. He teaches you, grades your work, and encourages you to keep doing good in his class. Meaning, he tells you what to do to lose weight, counts how many calories you take in and how many you burn, and compliments you when you lose weight or keep your calories low, which in return makes you want to keep doing ""well.""",k406qz,105,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/k406qz/just_a_thought/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-11-30 17:18:07

He had his own healthy pancake recipie and would make me pancakes every single day with sunflower seeds or walnuts in them. I didn‚Äôt realize how special that was until I got older. And for like a year in middle school my ED was so bad I would hide the pancakes and get rid of them. I would flush the pancakes my dad made me down the toilet. Every. Day.  I am consumed with guilt and sadness over this. More than anything else and all the people my behaviors hurt, this is the worst. 

I‚Äôm older now. I still live at home but my dad doesn‚Äôt make me breakfast anymore because I‚Äôm in college and should make it myself. I think about that year or two I wasted so much food, a direct representation of his love. I wish I could go back. I‚Äôd do anything to have him do that for me again. But I‚Äôm an adult and I have to take care of myself now. He loves me so, so much. So much he woke up early every day to feed me such good food and I just threw it away. fuck, I can‚Äôt believe I did that. I feel SO HORRIBLE. 

I wish I could go back and relive those days. I mean, I don‚Äôt, but I wish I could relive them without all the pain and mental illness. It‚Äôs not fair. I will never forgive myself for wasting my dads amazing food. I feel like I was throwing away his love every time I threw away his food. I hate so much that I did that. I wish I could undo it and experience all those pancake mornings over again. I wish I knew that in a few short years those special mornings would be over. 

Maybe I‚Äôll ask him to cook me breakfast a couple times a week. I just really miss it.",13edtrk,100,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/13edtrk/feeling_guilty_over_throwing_away_food_my_parents/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2023-05-11 05:17:33

Finding out about the porn was the trigger for my current relapse. 

We were fooling around the other night and he started trying to record me. I was ok with it at first but he started making comments that made me feel like he was 100% making a personal fetish video.

Recovery is so worth it. Trust me.,"So I struggled with anorexia for 3 years now. Those years were hell. I lost most of my friends and was just deteriorating slowly everyday. About 2 years ago I went ended up in general hospital then psychiatric hospital, it was a very traumatic experience. After a year in and out of hospitals I got discharged, not long after I relapsed again, but my weight was not that bad compared to before so I did not want or receive treatment. Fast forward to the beginning of this year.. not going to lie this was a really shit year for all of us, anyways, at the beginning of the year I promised to myself that I will get better. I was sick of just wasting my life. I was sick of doing nothing, dropping out of college and obsessing over food. I went back to lifting weights and kickboxing, wanted to weight gain slowly and also gained some muscleüí™üèª Quarantine helped me a lot, it held me uncountable. Days, weeks and months go by and eating more and more each day. I got my period after loosing it for a year 3 days ago. I started work in a cafe/restaurant place, they put me on the till. Which helped me deal with my social anxiety.  Started my photography and arts portfolio. Also studying for my driving licence.  My friend and I have applied for the London beat marathon next year. Have the motivation for life. In October I went to my first party. I met so many nice people and made friends. Yesterday, I met up with a girl I met at the party, which I consider her my best friend now. We went out for the whole day, had the best time. We drank a bit then we went to eat burgers, fries and milkshakes. The girl last year would never do that. I would of been terrified. But you know what? I did not care if I ate ‚Äútoo much‚Äù or how many calories I consumed. I just had fun. Everyone and I, around me have realised that I have been going out of my comfort zone. And people say that I am so fun to be around. I am so happy that I finally living my life, and I think that I am truly recovering and getting better. Although I am in a larger body now, I don‚Äôt want to be skinny I want to be happy strong and healthy. Don‚Äôt want to be vain but my hair is glowing, skin is clearing up and my clothes fit better, I am gaining so much confidence. I am starting to not care what people think of me no more. Today I might be going out with my friend and meeting up with the boy I like and I think he likes me too. Everything in life is starting to get better. I don‚Äôt get heart pain, dizziness or I am fainting all the time,  no more, how good is that? To anyone reading this thinking there is no hope and that they will not get better, I am telling you it will.‚ù§Ô∏è I am so happy I did not loose hope. To the girl I was 3 years who ended up in hospital, basically on her deathbed was given a couple weeks to live...I am so proud you took that fork.

I think I got over my dysmorphia but recently my friend has brought to my attention that I go the entire day without eating and I didn't realise myself. And I am not sure if that's a relapse,"I can tolerate looking at the mirror. I consider myself recovered, It's just that I am not sure if I am relapsing or something. 

I hung out with my friend a few times the past weeks since we were working of a project and last time we went out to eat because we were frustrated about the project and by the end of the day she was super concerned that all I had was some tea and water. I shrugged it off as ""just a stressful day"" and she reminded me of other days where it happened and she didn't say anything. I didn't even notice to begin with. Then I actually sort of realised that it happens somewhat frequent even when we aren't seeing each other. 

It's not like I am hungry or anything. I have been working so hard on improving and I don't want this to put me back to square 1 because I wasn't paying attention to have some regular meals.

I don't avoid foods or go out of my way to not eat or try to suppress hunger. We even went out TO eat and all I had was a tea. I feel super silly about but is it really a relapse or is it more of a habit or something?

edit/Update, 3 months later just in case:
i talked to my therapist and psychiatrist and decreased hunger is a side effect of my medication but the dosage is very difficult to adjust especially since the meds have long term effeciveness, i talked to my friends and we decided to have ""videocall mukbangs"" like eating together but at home in videocalls. i think i did get my eating back under control, and today i actually looked in the mirror and genuinely felt pretty. it is such a strange feeling. eitherway, meal prepping has helped me with reminders to eat, i take my sweet time to eat as long as i do eat.
i am so thankful for everyone's support and nice words <3",hb0k6s,101,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/hb0k6s/i_think_i_got_over_my_dysmorphia_but_recently_my/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-06-17 21:28:41
I feel like asking for help as sent me back into old habits,"I called a nutritionist center specialized in eating disorders, one of the question the secretary lady asked me on the phone when I was booking an appointment was what my lowest weight was and upon hearing my answer she just sort of naturally said ""oh so it wasn't that bad like you didn't have to go to the hospital or anything"" and as much as I know she didn't mean to make me feel like utter shite by saying that she still made me feel like utter shite by saying that. 
The rational side of my brain really wants me to believe that it's probably just because they must be used to dealing with people who got way worse than me but the disordered side of my brain keeps telling me I didn't get sick enough to deserve recovery. I was working really hard to recover and it was a really big step for me to call a nutritionist for help especially since it happened over the phone and it just shocked me so much that I feel like I'm now worse than I was to begin with.

My flatmate likes to monitor my food even though he knows I have an ED,"I've asked him so many times to stop commenting on my food intake and to stop telling me to eat different things or less or whatever. I'm underweight and I'm not eating that much right now out of stress. He is into eating healthy and very anti-coffee, anti-sugar.
I struggle with stress and fatigue and I do drink coffee, and he will tell me every time that I shouldn't be having that.
I told him I have an ED and to stop and he was like 'here's some pics of someone way skinnier than you if that makes you feel better' and tries to give me like advice on how to recover.
We were sat the other night and I made a joke that I have bad concentration and he said 'maybe if you cut out that coffee you might get better. If you had just stopped eating sugar like I told you to months ago, you wouldn't have that problem, and now look at you'
If I have a snack late at night he makes comments like 'maybe if you stopped eating after 6pm you'd sleep better and wouldnt be here late at night'
I'm really losing patience with him because I'm a fully grown adult and I dont need him telling me I cant have certain things in my life or I have to stop eating at certain times and only eat x,y,z. It's infuriating.
Despite knowing I've had anorexia and I'm still umderweight, he keeps encouraging me to restrict and telling me that if I eat certain things I'll ruin my body.

In this phase I'm not eating because my ED is better. I'm eating because my body has been starving for so long that it just can't take it anymore, and it becomes stronger than my thoughts to restrict.


I'm too scared to tell my dietitian that I'm eating more now and have stopped losing weight, sometimes even gaining it, because I fear the invalidation of her thinking my ED is better.

like my eating disorder

maybe i‚Äôm oversensitive

the weight of your weight talk

you and i aren‚Äôt so different 

letting a silly number on a scale rule our lives

but my sickness is your self-care

and when you asked me for diet advice

i went home and cried for you

this self control you see in me

is weakness at the core

i don‚Äôt want you to feel this pain

"Is it Weird to Have ""Safe Utensils""?","I always shop in the baby food section of stores and recently I bought a set of plates, bowls, utensils, and even went so far as to buy a bottle so that drinking wouldn't be so hard; simply because they're *small* and that makes me feel...better? It's got something to do with the fact that a.) I'm not eating like everyone else usually does (like ""normal people do"") so that translates to: ""I'm being good"", and b.) the smaller portion size cuts my anxiety down in half almost. So my question is: is this just me being completely bizarre or does that make sense in some...weird way?

I met him because he works at my community college and it was love at first sight. We had a 6 hour first date and didn't stop talking for ages. I went away for the summer and he watched my pet while I was away, and when I came back I started sleeping over at his house more and more. 

He was very insistent that he didn't want me to move in and that mon-wed and the weekends together was great, but he needed more space. 

I was always honest with him about my recovery. I slipped a few times with not eating and told him how much he helped. I was always very grateful when he did the dishes and cooked for me, just as much as he was grateful when I would cook for him. 

I got a bit too housewifey, even though I work and go to school, and I think it scared him off. He's always been the sort of person where he defines success based on having a good career, I've always wanted a good home. 

When breaking up with me, he said he couldn't stand knowing that if he forgets to pack me lunch or bring me a snack that I just don't eat. It made him so sad to know that I only eat in front of others that it weighed on him. He said it felt like walking on eggshells and that he couldn't open up when he knew how bad I was some days. He said that the good times were good but he simply stopped loving me and didn't see us together in the future.

Sigh.

I miss him, I love him, and I'm doing insane person math to try and figure out how long it will take for him to miss me. If anyone else is insane, I'd really appreciate psychoanalyzing his fear of commitment getting in the way of his career with you. Fuck. I haven't stopped crying since it happened, even at my cubicle.",eiaval,103,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eiaval/boyfriend_left_me_because_i_was_too_much_to_take/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2019-12-31 23:49:27
My(24f) ex girlfriend‚Äôs (24f) ex (26f) suffered from Anorexia and died this summer. I‚Äôm still very upset,"My ex girlfriend‚Äôs ex‚Äî M, passed away this summer after a routine tonsillectomy, and was severely underweight after struggling with anorexia for many years.

We were extremely similar in many ways, as we both struggled with eating disorders‚Äî except she did not have health insurance that would pay for treatment. We had an amicable relationship, and she reached out to talk to me quite a bit given the fact I was dating her ex. 

Now my ex and I are broken up, and I‚Äôm still very upset by M‚Äôs passing. She was so beautiful and sweet, and suffered with anorexia so badly. She even reached out to talk about her boy problems with me and I stupidly waved her off. I regret it so badly now, who the fuck cares I was dating her ex?? I should‚Äôve responded.

The current guy I‚Äôm casually dating doesn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm so heartbroken over her passing even though we didn‚Äôt talk much. It just hurts so badly to understand the specific place she was in with anorexia, even down to how her body would have felt at that weight (she passed away at around my lowest weight). 

She received a routine tonsillectomy, and her body was so weak that she hemorrhaged twice, the second time going into anaphylactic shock after losing too much blood. I‚Äôm not sure quite why I posted this here, but I guess I hoped someone would understand why I‚Äôm so sad that someone so much like me died. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if she would still be alive if she had access to treatment like me. And hell, I‚Äôve honestly been starving myself too. 

I love you so much M, you and I were so so alike in so many ways, down to our father issues, love of Japan, even our specific mix of racial ethnicities‚Äî but I wish Anorexia is something we didn‚Äôt share. You basically had a harder version of my life. I wish I could have given you my nice health insurance that pays for 100% of the premium at the stupid fucking fancy treatment center I went to by the beach that has catered restaurant night, art therapy, and a whole bunch of other things.",eaz6rz,100,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/eaz6rz/my24f_ex_girlfriends_24f_ex_26f_suffered_from/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2019-12-15 13:54:44

Does anyone else struggle with hydration?,"I was never good at drinking water, but after I was hospitalized and weight-restored, I tended to get really dehydrated to the point of needing IVs. I've gotten a bit better but I still tend to just for whatever reason not drink as much water as I need. I have phases where I continually fill up a tumbler/water bottle and am good with it then. Part of it is laziness, but I feel like part of it is psychological. I was wondering if anyone else experiences this too. I know some people drink a lot of water to keep their stomachs full but for me even when I'm eating the best, I still don't drink a lot. It sounds so dumb, I can't describe it.

Anyway, I was posting to another forum and someone was like ""it isn't that hard to drink more water"" and that really bothered me for some reason? I guess because for me it *is* and it felt like someone saying ""it isn't that hard to eat more"" which is why it made me really consider whether this is some sort of weird subliminal ED behavior.

Can we normalize not commenting on people‚Äôs food?!?,"I work at a grocery store which usually gives me time to pick out stuff ahead of time but I still spent my entire break stressing trying to decide what my ED will allow me to put into my body for my required nutrients of the day.

So I get to checkout actually excited to have all this good shit to enjoy for the rest of the day.

Reminders If You‚Äôre Thinking Of Recovering,"Thinking of recovering? I‚Äôm so happy to hear :) 

Here‚Äôs a check list of things I wish I had known before starting to recover *AKA* reminders to keep you safe, calm, and know what to expect during the process.

1. Expect to be very bloated for first week or so. (Refeeding edema). Caused by weakened GI muscles.

2. The only way to get rid of the bloating is to keep eating. Restricting and fasting will only result in prolonged duration of bloating. 

3. UP YOUR INTAKE SLOWLY. Drastic changes in the amount your consuming will cause terrible nausea. ):

4. Try drinking yummy liquids instead of full solid meals the first few days. This is easier on your digestive system. Shakes and smoothies are your friends! 

5. The first few meals or even snacks you eat may cause you to feel extremely sleepy. This is because your body is using the first amount of energy given to repair damage and digest. 

6. It is possible you will lose your period while in recovery. However, once you are both weight restored and have good nutritional intake, it will return. 

7. Some days will be easier than others. There are mornings I wake up and suddenly feel anxious over silly calories again. This is okay! Take deep breaths, and give yourself extra time while cooking/eating etc. 

8. Even safe spaces about EDs can be triggering. The MOMENT you get the motivation to, delete the photos, the apps, the discord servers, etc. You don‚Äôt owe them an explanation. You owe yourself life. 

9. Make a list of food you always wanted to eat but never could while your ED was in control. Check them off whenever you can! Even if it‚Äôs just one bite, or several servings!!

10. DON‚ÄôT believe that recovery competition crap. It‚Äôs okay if you can‚Äôt finish a plate, but it‚Äôs also okay if you do. It‚Äôs also STILL okay if you get seconds. Food do be yummy, and we‚Äôre allowed to have yummy things. 

11. A relapse is not the same thing as a lapse. Sometimes I have lapses. But that just means i‚Äôm human. Your body forgives you, please forgive yourself.

12. FINALLY, recovery is simply recovery. Recovery means to heal from your past ways. It is not defined by how easy or hard recovery is for you. Your struggle existed, it was enough. You don‚Äôt have to be tortured to be valid.

Even when I sleep I have nightmares about my anorexia,"At night I dream about my eating disorder.

I can't rest properly. I'll either have nightmares about being morbidly obese, where I'm just stuffing my face full of food in front of all my mates and family members- or I'll have dreams where I physically slice the fat off myself. They're all so vivid.

Sometimes they wake me up suddenly. I've never been one to wake up in an obvious panic like you see in films. But I'll wake up and in those first few disorientating minutes of consciousness, lay there in complete disarray, thinking it was all real.

I can't count all of the times I've woken up thinking I binged, when in fact it was only a nightmare. And equally as bad, the amount of times I've woken up with severe stomach pains from literally sucking in my stomach as I sleep.

There's no escape. Sleeping is almost more of a nightmare than being awake. I just want it all to stop, so fucking tired. I feel like I should be stronger. Men should be strong. That's what society has been drilling into my since I was a child. But I can't be strong now, and it makes me feel pathetic.",jz7bxh,97,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/jz7bxh/even_when_i_sleep_i_have_nightmares_about_my/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-11-23 00:43:50
I just need to let someone know,"I‚Äôm fasting again.

I know this is bad. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have. I know I feel BETTER when I eat food. But I dont LOOK better. 

Something I realized after years of therapy is that I want to be sick enough. It‚Äôs messed up but I just want so badly to be sick. And as much as it feels awful. At this point its part of my brand. 

I want to be that cute sick girl that everyone cant help but take care of.

Things I want to say as an anorexic but just can‚Äôt.,"- I spent years destroying my body. I am weak. Stop commenting on it. 
- I‚Äôm hyper aware of my weight at all times. Never. ever. comment. on. it. 
- You don‚Äôt have the right to touch me/pick me up whenever you want just because I am shrinking. 
- Just because I‚Äôm soft spoken and scared of being the center of attention doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to be listened to. Stop speaking over me. 
- STOP. GIVING. ME. HEALTH. ADVICE. I‚Äôve taken multiple classes on nutrition and health sciences. I know what I‚Äôm doing. I have a disorder. 
- If my body is exhausted and I spend a day in bed, DONT. CALL. ME. LAZY. At my worst I was logging 6-10 miles every day. This is a SUCCESS. 
- Dont tell me to track my calories to make sure I‚Äôm getting enough. Tracking calories is a trigger for EVERYONE WITH AN ED. 
- I want to spend time with you.  If you know I have an ED, please don‚Äôt suggest we go out to eat. I have a hard time saying no, but this is way too scary for me.

I miss it,"I miss restricting. I miss the control, focus and single-mindedness I have when I'm restricting. 

I've been ""in recovery"" from my anorexia for several years now. I'm putting that in air quotes because I was honestly never sure I really recovered. I just gained weight and got to a healthy BMI so my family would get the hell off my back. My thinking isn't any less disordered than it's ever been. I still fear food. I still split foods into good and bad. I still feel like I have to burn off or earn every bite of food I put into my mouth. I have a weight I won't let myself get under, but I also have a weight I won't let myself get over. Sometimes I intentionally get precariously close to my highest allowed weight just so I could restrict in peace for a while and pretend that I'm just ""being healthy"" and ""trying to lose a few pounds"".

I also feel terrible when I forget to ask for customisations or forget to look up nutritional values (whenever possible).

I was wondering if anyone else has the compulsion to body check and how you deal with the stress that comes with the urges. I literally can't stop pulling and prodding at myself and constantly looking at my stomach and comparing it, seeing if it moves at all, if it's grown, bloated, etc.

I'm obsessed with feeling my hips and sides to see if they feel concaved or the same. If both sides look the same, etc. 

It gets insanely hard at night because I lay on my stomach and feel myself breathing or my heart thumping and feel the compulsion to ""smooth my stomach down"" to make sure it feels flat and even, unmoved, etc. 

Please is there anyone who does this or who can give me a rational about this, it's so hard to deal with. I can't relax. I can't stop doing this. It's really bad now.

how am i supposed to recover when nothing compares to this?,"what will ever make me feel as accomplished as this? there is nothing more tangible or gratifying than watching your body chew on itself. how am i supposed to just leave it behind? i can't. because this is like diabetes or something. you can manage it, keep it at bay, but it's never actually gonna go away. i'd rather just get it over with.

i could recover but it will always be in the back of my mind -- that easy way to feel fulfilled. that easy goal and mission and purpose. something to take up all the space in my head so that i don't have to think about all the things i'd rather not. it will always be on the backburner itching at me. and i know because i was fully recovered for nearly four years, after 1 1/2 years treatment. it's so easy to get swallowed back up again. why fight it anymore. nobody else has the energy too, either, and i don't blame them. i've been wanting them to realize they're as helpless as i am.

logically i know this is pathetic. and boring. and tedious. anorexia is tedious. it is uninteresting and i am uninteresting and devoid of personality. i know that this is unhealthy. but people do unhealthy things all the time. drinking and smoking, eating junk food, and rotting in bed. so how come my unhealthy is so much worse? why can't i have this one thing that makes me feel fulfilled? either i can hate my body, myself, and feel stagnant and unfulfilled... or i can hate my body, myself, but know that i am fixing it? that i am chiseling away at myself? that it's being taken care of?",105kyfr,94,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/105kyfr/how_am_i_supposed_to_recover_when_nothing/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2023-01-07 09:25:56
my therapist revealed that she has an eating disorder,"TW | to preface, I just wanna say I‚Äôm really bummed about this because I felt like I was really clicking with this therapist. during my session last week with her, she asked me what my biggest fear would be with my eating disorder. I was thinking about it and maybe she thought I was confused by the question, so she took that opportunity to tell me she struggles with an eating disorder as well, and that her biggest fear would be any sort of medical intervention (i.e, ending up in the ER, a feeding tube, forced rehabilitation, etc). I like to consider myself moderately recovered, so that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve been concerned about for a few years. When I was less stable in my recovery, however, that‚Äôs definitely something I would have fixated on. I feel uncomfortable that she told me, and I feel like I now have to be careful about what I say to her. 

then this week, she cancelled our session ~4 hours prior to the appointment time because she ‚Äúhad to go to the ER, doc‚Äôs orders‚Äù(direct quote). now, of course I‚Äôm not upset she had to prioritize her own health in that moment, but I can‚Äôt help wondering if it‚Äôs related to her eating disorder, and I can‚Äôt shake this feeling that I‚Äôm further along in my recovery than she is. I feel wrong talking at-length about my triggers to her, so I think I will likely end up getting another therapist.

BUT here‚Äôs my issue- I think she should know that that‚Äôs probably not a thing she should share with her patients, especially those recovering from an eating disorder. I don‚Äôt really want to have the conversation with her directly, I don‚Äôt know how she would take it and I hate that I‚Äôm in this weird position of worrying about the feelings of my therapist (I also hate confrontation). but I also think about future potential clients who are in the beginning stages of their recovery that could be triggered by her. I feel almost an obligation to speak up about it. 

Help.

ETA:

Thank you to everyone who responded!! Fortunately I‚Äôm working through betterhelp so I have the option to match with a new therapist (or at least try) and I‚Äôm going to take that option. I also have the option to communicate with her through messages within the app so I plan to explain why I‚Äôm switching before I do so.

Living with an ED is so strange,"I want to have energy. I want to enjoy the foods I used to love but now fear. I want to be able to eat and cook without feeling like everyone is watching me. I want to be able to enjoy meals I want to try. I want to not have to obsess over calories. I want to not feel drained and empty all the time. I want to have the energy to talk to people. I want to eat without the guilt.

But at the same time I just as bad want to be as thin as I can. Part of me wants to get sick. Part of me thrives of lying about food. Part of me is so addicted to seeing the numbers get lower. Part of me sees lying about what I ate and hiding food as a game or challenge. Part of me feels so much guilt after eating or wanting to eat. Part of me is so addicted to fasting. Part of me is so addicted and thrives off control and see all the physical and mental ways this illness is destroying me.

Why do I always feel like my eating disorder isn't valid,Here goes another reason. I fear that my eating disorder isn't valid because I can't restrict as much as others at least yet. And I eat a whole lot of food sometimes just because it's good food and even though my brain screams for me not to eat I can't resist it and then I feel guilty about not being able to restrict as much as I hoped,pr2fat,94,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/pr2fat/why_do_i_always_feel_like_my_eating_disorder_isnt/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-09-19 05:59:39

i don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm doing this anymore,"when i was a teenager and developed anorexia, that was it, that was all i wanted from life, was to be as skinny as possible and then die. i lived by pro-ana tumblr and their stupid mantras like ‚Äúi‚Äôd rather be a skinny corpse‚Äù and all that bullshit. 

now i‚Äôm an adult with a loving, healthy relationship, on the career path to my dream job, supportive friends and family, a cat i love with all my heart, i want to be alive. i want to experience all the great things life can offer and there‚Äôs only one thing standing in my way: my own sick brain. 

i feel so immature. i know that eating disorders have no age limit and maybe it‚Äôs just because i‚Äôve struggled since i was so young but i just wish i could outgrow this mindset and genuinely want to recover. but it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm stuck here and i don‚Äôt even know why. i‚Äôm just sabotaging myself at this point.

last week i was given the opportunity to become a full time employee at my job, a stepping stone in the direction of where i want to be in my career. it made me panic because i don‚Äôt have the physical stamina to work full time, and i straight up told my boss ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know if i can do that.‚Äù this confused him because he thought that was what i wanted, and it is what i want, but i work in a physically demanding field and i already feel like i‚Äôm at my limit. 

i‚Äôve already been to treatment twice, and don‚Äôt know if i can put my loved ones through that again. the memory of seeing my dad cry sitting across from me in an eating disorder hospital, begging me to put in the effort to get better, breaks my heart whenever i think about it. i haven‚Äôt even had the heart to tell him i‚Äôm still struggling.

the only one who knows how bad it still is, is my boyfriend. he‚Äôs so supportive. every time i eat something, he tells me he‚Äôs proud of me, and he always texts me to remind me to eat when we‚Äôre apart/at work. i wish the love and support could just magically penetrate my stupid brain and i‚Äôd just suddenly want to do better but here i am.

i got home from work today and just broke down. there‚Äôs an uneaten strawberry frosted donut that my best friend bought for me three days ago still sitting here because i haven‚Äôt had the heart to throw it away because it was so nice of her to try to get me to eat my favorite colored treat but i couldn‚Äôt do it. i feel broken. i feel like i‚Äôm letting so many people in my life down. i‚Äôm sorry for venting on here to such a long extent but this is the only place i could think of to write this.",otial1,92,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/otial1/i_dont_know_why_im_doing_this_anymore/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-07-28 20:29:19

Thanks Dad.,"""Treating"" self (aka punishing myself for the sake of recovery) to some ice cream.

Apparently there's a new trans trend called 'anamaxxing',"Apparently the past couple of years there is a new trend in trans circles called ""anamaxxing""   
(think ""ana+looksmaxxing"")

I think the idea is that to achieve a more feminine or masculine physique either before or at the start of hormone replacement therapy the ""anamaxxer"" goes all out (in what would otherwise in *any* other context be considered absolutely ""proana"" behavior) in order to drastically reduce body fat across the board.

Then because of the presence of the cross-sex hormones that fat is later regained (with eating) but is more likely to be distributed in the desired masculine or feminine way (different parts of the face, different parts of the body, etc.) versus the typical feminization or masculinization cosmetic surgeries.

Would this be considered the same as ""ED pro ana"" or not pro ana, or not an ED at all?",13rebio,92,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/13rebio/apparently_theres_a_new_trans_trend_called/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2023-05-25 10:44:38

You could tell me that anorexia would destroy my digestive system, make my energy level plummet, risk me dying of a heart attack at 24, and none of that would cause me to recover. But this week I ran my fingers through my hair and noticed all the thinning patches on my scalp and it finally sent me over the edge. I've been dealing with on/off restrictions for over a decade. Constantly comparing myself to other people I see in public, wanting to be runway model thin. I'm so fucking sick of it. I barely see my friends because I *know* we'll be eating when we're together, I eat dinner with my family once a week at most, and my mom has noticed that I don't eat meals I love anymore (pasta, bread, etc.). I miss who I was before anorexia. I miss eating high-calorie meals and nourishing my body. I miss having my period despite the excruciating cramps I would get the first two days. I was really stupid enough to think I could magically avoid hair loss by taking two Biotin gummies every morning and eating fewer calories than a toddler each day. I want to be happy in life because I get one shot at this and now I'm about to spend my mid-20s trying to reverse a decade of mental illness. I'm too embarrassed to ask for help/support from those I know in real life and I can't afford therapy/medication so I'm getting all my information from the internet and just *hoping* this all works out. Recovery is going to be so fucking hard and I know it won't be linear, I'll likely have days where my intake is low and days where I eat like a pig out of shame and desperation, but it's something I need to do. I refuse to let this have any more control over my life and I am determined to beat her into the fucking ground.",12u4ecc,93,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/12u4ecc/ive_finally_reached_my_breaking_point/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2023-04-21 14:41:42

Easily the worst Easter ever,"Sorry this is a bit longer, I just really have to get this out of my head because it‚Äôs been bothering me since yesterday. I relapsed at the start of this year, and it‚Äôs not been easy at all. I‚Äôve told no one, not even my boyfriend, who thinks I‚Äôm just dieting. He also let his family be aware of this because he stopped bringing me food home from family events or dinners per my request. This relapse has been my hardest in a long while, and everything happened pretty quick this go around, so even if I can‚Äôt see it, it‚Äôs hard to go unnoticed. 

Yesterday we had a family dinner with my boyfriends family. My anxiety was already pretty high knowing there were going to be food and people, so I wanted to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù pretty enough to be there. I opted for literally the only dress I own that I think I look sort of okay in. Simple, black dress with short sleeves, mid-thigh. We walk into the house and quite literally the first 5 seconds I‚Äôm there his mom says ‚Äúoh my god, you‚Äôre bones, you need to stop‚Äù. Cue in her boyfriend who says being rail thin isn‚Äôt unhealthy. They go back and forth on this while I‚Äôm literally wanting to disappear immediately. 

Shortly after, everyone else shows up. Bf‚Äôs dad, brother, and his two friends. We‚Äôre all sat at the table chatting, no ones bothered with food yet because they‚Äôre all drinking or smoking, and out of no where she chimes in again and says ‚Äúisn‚Äôt she just so pretty? This girl if she had on make-up would look like Princess Diana‚Äù. My mind is thinking what in the actual fuck is going on. She starts asking dieting advice, what I eat, what exercise I do, fucking everything. I can‚Äôt very well be honest about it so I have to toss out generic advice about Healthy weight loss. It went on like this for three fucking hours though. An entire dinner focused on my fucking body.

It‚Äôs just really fucking hard to be this way, and shit like this almost fuels me to keep being the way I am. I don‚Äôt know what I look like. I‚Äôve no fucking clue.

The road to recovery will not always be consistently positive, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel rushed to recover anyway if that‚Äôs even in your interest.

Some days I can eat pizza and chocolate and feel fine, and other days I‚Äôll cry over ice cream. 

Recovery is an emotional rollercoaster no matter what stage you‚Äôre in- you‚Äôre allowed to have bad days where you may feel sad or anxious. One day isn‚Äôt going to derail your progress unless you let it.


It‚Äôs ok to be emotionally fragile, it‚Äôs ok to cry, it‚Äôs ok to feel conflicted sometimes. All emotions are valid and deserve recognition.

"[PSA, I guess?] If you haven't gotten help because your BMI is ""normal"", please read.","So, I was referred to an ED specialist a while ago. I didn't think it was enough of an issue to warrant treatment, mostly because my BMI is normal... but I figured I should just do it. So I could prove to my family that it's not an issue. 

During my consult, the therapist said that it's common for people with anorexia to not seek help because they don't think they're sick enough, and that *BMI is not only inaccurate*, but it's potentially dangerous because it **stops people from seeking help.** I guess I was one of them because she wants me to do IOP.  

The consult was pretty scary because I didn't realize that things were that bad. I knew hair loss and changes in/loss of menstruation were signs that something is wrong but I figured it was unrelated because... again, BMI is normal. 

I wanted to post this here because I had no idea that the BMI chart was THAT off, or that a person could be malnourished enough to start losing their hair but still be a ""normal weight"" for their height... and maybe someone else didn't know either. 

TL;DR: Your BMI doesn't really matter, if you don't eat you're probably malnourished and if you're struggling with eating you should get help. Don't wait until you think you're sick enough. Also if your hair is falling out that's probably a sign that you should get help. 

P.S. Throwaway account.

Parents just not understanding,"
My parents REFUSE to look up things online related to my ED and what recovery is - only the stuff that is provided by my treatment team but like most things, it doesn‚Äôt cover everything, mainly the physical aspect (bloating etc in regards to recovery) so they believe I‚Äôm talking UTTER RUBBISH when I speak about ‚Äúhonouring hunger‚Äù,  ‚Äúpermission to eat‚Äù, ‚Äúbody dysmorphia‚Äù and ‚Äúcompulsive exercise‚Äù they just tell me to stop looking at things online 

There is so much more to recovery and my ED as it is a mental disorder it goes far beyond just ‚Äúfollowing a meal plan‚Äù as it can be quite disordered really (permission to eat) 

Is there ANYTHING I could show them?

AN is back... I can‚Äòt fight it anymore,"Hi everyone.
I hope you‚Äòre all fine. I was just thinking about sharing my story with y‚Äòall, so here I am.

Since I was a little kid, I was struggling with AN.
I was never happy with my weight and with the way I looked. I felt fat and I still do. 
I remember a time, ( I was 12 years old ) where I would literally starve myself until I fell over. I started to loose my hair and everytime I got up, my eyes went black.
Then in summer, me and my parents went to Greece. We were at the airport and I could literally pull out my hair. I remember that look in my parents eyes. They were so scared, they couldn‚Äòt talk to me anymore.

A year had passed and I recovered. It wasn‚Äôt that hard back then, tbh.

I was healthy, I did a lot of sports and was eating well.
But AN still hadn‚Äòt disappeared in my head.

From 15 to 17 I had a little relapse again. I don‚Äòt know why, but somehow this feeling/disease never went away... but still, I didn‚Äòt have to go to the hospital or so...

And now... 18 yrs old, I‚Äòm literally on the verge of dispair. 
My best friend (met her in college) has bulimia, her sister had anorexia and I felt like I was only fighting my AN for her. I didn‚Äòt want her to think I had AN too. I know it would literally break her heart and make her feel even worse. But about a month ago I just couldn‚Äòt take it anymore. I felt so bad in my own skin, I couldn‚Äòt look at myself in the mirror anymore and I was weighing myself so much more often than I did before (4-5 times a day). I started starving myself again and something I never did and that scares me a lot... I started purging, which was the worst decision ever.
I‚Äòd say, I sometimes CAN control it and tell myself: DON‚ÄòT DO THIS TO YOURSELF, IT‚ÄòS DANGEROUS !

But it‚Äòs hard. Very hard.

And of course you can imagine how hard those Christmas days were. I didn‚Äòt spend one day without purging. It was just grueling.

Luckily I have someone, who helped me a lot.
But I have a lot of guilt towards him. He literally spent hours and hours trying to help me and trying to understand me... But I just could never follow his advice because it is so hard.

And you know what‚Äôs the worst?
I can‚Äòt even eat or drink anymore without weighing myself or purging until I lost enough weight. 
My parents are literally at the end of their rope and of course I feel extremely guilty because I do all this to them and I am their only child. 

It‚Äòs just terrible and I know I should get help.. but I‚Äôll soon have my finals and I need to make it, even though I know, it‚Äòll be hard.

Anyway... that was my story.
Unfortunately I lost a lot of weight and it‚Äòs becoming less everyday. It really scares me.

Thanks to all who took the time to read this. 
It means a lot to me.",kmoei8,88,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/kmoei8/an_is_back_i_cant_fight_it_anymore/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2020-12-29 22:20:17

Today, I was talking about how I‚Äôve gained a little weight since then and felt uncomfortable with how the shorts fit.

Her natural response: Well, just go on a diet if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with your body.

I‚Äôd rather starve than go to the kitchen,"I‚Äôve been suffering from anorexic tendencies for reasons that will be made clear soon enough, but this quarantine has worsened them by 100%. 

My grandma is in the kitchen, now living with us when before she was not, the whole day listening to the radio and every time I go to the kitchen she‚Äôll comment on my weight before I‚Äôve even crossed the door. Things like ‚Äúyou are so skinny!‚Äù ‚ÄúIt would be a shame if you got fat.‚Äù ‚ÄúBe careful with what you eat‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre eating too much aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù (I‚Äôm not, I haven‚Äôt had a proper meal in about 3 days). 

It‚Äôs driving me crazy, and if I try to call her out on it my mother says I‚Äôm being disrespectful and that she is only concerned about my health. Not that my mother is any better or hasn‚Äôt said any similar comments on occasion... 

I don‚Äôt know what to do... I don‚Äôt feel hungry but I feel weak and miserable and even though I can go down at night I can‚Äôt bring myself to eat more than a glass of juice and half a cracker for fear of overeating, plus sometimes I father is there unexpectedly and he‚Äôs creepy in a way I‚Äôd rather not get into.

i hate anorexia,"i‚Äôm never skinny enough. the thought of gaining weight terrifies me. i have really bad stomach issues now thanks to anorexia and i feel nauseous when i eat. i think of food as a number. as how much weight i‚Äôll gain. i see all the fat on my body and i want to have a panic attack. i feel out of control and like i‚Äôm going to gain so much weight if i‚Äôm not restricting. it‚Äôs not even a beauty thing anymore. it‚Äôs a jealousy, control, anxiety thing now. i know i‚Äôm never going to be satisfied. restricting is like an addiction. even the thought of eating more and gaining weight makes me want to cry",14hw5zx,87,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14hw5zx/i_hate_anorexia/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2023-06-24 15:45:07

i hate how i feel about myself, and ik seeing my body in a reflection will make me hate myself more.

Don't make fun of people's eating habits,"I heard my parents talking about one of my eating habits this morning and I'm feeling like I just don't want to eat ever again. 

I have pretty intense stomach issues unfortunately, and that greatly restricts what foods I can and can't eat. Recently, I've been eating a lot of sandwiches because it's good protein (which I've been told I need more of) and they don't bother my stomach. This morning after I woke up, though, I heard my parents saying about how ""I ate two bags of chips in two days"". I usually eat some chips with my sandwich, but not that much. I know that I've been eating more chips, but that's only because I eat sandwiches more often and I like them together. 

I just feel really sad because that was one of my only safe foods and now I know they make fun of me. I didn't think anyone in my family would because they know how bad my stomach is and know how I can't ear certain foods. I've also had a really decreases appetite due to my stomach issues, so I don't know why they're making fun of me eating at all. Yesterday was the first day in a while that I ate three proper meals and I was really proud of myself, but now I just feel like I'm eating too much :/

Sorry for the venting, but I just need some support.",wbzswe,86,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/wbzswe/dont_make_fun_of_peoples_eating_habits/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2022-07-30 15:17:14

my boyfriend follows these girls who are stunning and it makes me feel nauseous after every time I eat but I can't get them out of my head,"well, the title says most of it. the worst part is, they're girls he knows/ is friends with and they follow him back so i doubt he'd want to unfollow them. I've been obsessively looking at their feed for so long and I just can't get them out of my head. they're all so skinny and beautiful I feel like a fat ugly cow compared to them.  I'm so so jealous of them it makes me feel like my skin is on fire, the jealousy is the worst emotion I've ever felt . I can see the exact posts in my head as I'm typing and the back of my throat feels bitter like I'm about to throw up and I am so aware of the feeling of my fat just on my body. not to mention they all look stunning with very minimal makeup and I could never look like them. to make it worse, I spoke with one of them and she was so sweet. it makes me feel like such a monster to feel so horribly about someone and yet act like nothing is wrong when I speak to them.

it makes me feel like shit even though I know he wouldn't leave me I feel like deep down every time he looks at my body he is just thinking of theirs. I feel like he misses how I used to look when my ed was bad near when we first met and I feel like I've trapped him into being with me when I look so fat and unattractive all the time in front of him

edit: thank you guys so so much for the support I cried reading some of the comments tbh haha.

why do people purposefully trigger me knowing i have an eating disorder?,"possible trigger warning?

today i mentioned that when people tell me that i'm ""getting better"" doesn't help, it makes me feel worse and want to relapse. my devil sister heard this and told me ""you're getting better"". i look at her and i stay quiet, and she just laughs. after that, it was like i was screaming at myself (in my head) these bad things that i don't want to say as i don't want to trigger anyone, but they were bad. my dad said this today to my psychiatrist. he doesn't know that its one of my triggers, but it still made me feel bad. it made me want to get worse. this isn't the first time my sister has done something like this. she said something worse (again, i don't want to say as i don't want to trigger anyone) and i bursted out crying and i felt like shit for a long time because of her. my parents say things that trigger me when they sort of know that it upsets me. so, why do people trigger me knowing that i get triggered by a lot of things?  it's not fair. i already feel like shit all the time, both physically and emotionally but then this? i just want people to understand me, not this stuff :/",o2db2h,87,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/o2db2h/why_do_people_purposefully_trigger_me_knowing_i/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-06-18 01:30:13

I can‚Äôt even enjoy my comfort media anymore.,"I‚Äôm in a severe relapse, and it‚Äôs caused me to push away almost all of my loved ones. I lash out at everybody I talk to. I‚Äôm too scared to go meet friends or family because they‚Äôll want to eat, too scared to get back into baking/cooking for obvious reasons, too scared to even go outside in case somebody looks a little too hard at me. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd even have the energy to, anyway. The little strength I have, I throw into my studies and my job, but I‚Äôm struggling to keep up with even that. My grades are slipping little by little and even 15 hours a week is pushing it for me. I feel so pathetic and alone. Everything is so overwhelming.

I‚Äôve always coped with hard times by completely throwing myself into fictional worlds, but lately it just isn‚Äôt working anymore. I‚Äôll try to read a couple chapters of something or play a bit of one of my favorite games, but I just can‚Äôt get into it. All I can think about is how none of it‚Äôs real, and as soon as I put the book down or turn off the TV I have to go back to my real, shitty life... And that‚Äôs excruciating for me. I can‚Äôt enjoy anything at all. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I‚Äôve been through a lot with my ED, but I never thought it would take my stories.

anyone else have a fear of becoming obese?,"i know that fear of gaining weight is a pretty much universal thing for anorexia, but does anyone else have a fear of actual obesity? like i‚Äôm genuinely terrified that once i start eating more i just won‚Äôt stop. i‚Äôll just keep eating and eating and never stop until i‚Äôm 300 pounds because i lost all my self control when i stopped restricting. plus hearing about how many people go from anorexia to binge eating disorder doesn‚Äôt help either. i know it‚Äôs not like that for everyone but what if it is for me? i‚Äôm so terrified of it that i literally have nightmares about it, and imaging it happening makes me feel sick with anxiety. i just hope i‚Äôm not the only one cus i feel crazy",kwdigq,88,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/kwdigq/anyone_else_have_a_fear_of_becoming_obese/,AnorexiaNervosa,top,2021-01-13 10:02:54
I am so alone.,"I‚Äôm a 16 year old male who‚Äôs been suffering from anorexia for two years now, entering my 3rd year and have been fake recovered to some extent like 5 times now but every time has me going back down the same path I was on when restricting.

I‚Äôm approaching the weight I was at when I was at my worst and everyday I have to deal with constantly being body shamed by my family/friends who have no idea what I‚Äôm going through no matter how many attempts I‚Äôve given to explain fully about what I‚Äôm going through.

Because I‚Äôm a boy I don‚Äôt get a lot of recognition for these struggles, I‚Äôm just ‚Äúthe skinny one who doesn‚Äôt eat a lot‚Äù in peoples eyes.

On top of this I live in a place where there‚Äôs virtually nowhere to go for eating disorders, there‚Äôs no programs or people to help me. I feel like I‚Äôm approaching the end of my road and at this point I am ready to stop fighting and give up.

do you experience oDdLy specific challenges RIGHT after recovering that tempt you back into your eating disorder?,"Do y‚Äôall find that as SOON as you get to a good place in recovery something comes along that wants to push you right back?

I know that challenges will come but it‚Äôs just crazy how quickly and specific they seem to be to your own personal weaknesses.

Which was great but also what starting my eating disorder in the first place years ago so it was soooo hard to not relapse (& I kinda did a bit).

Nothing worse than eating in front of my parents,It makes me unreasonably upset when I‚Äôm making food in the kitchen or getting ready to eat and my parents just walk in.

I‚Äôm 1 minute away from being done and in comes my dad whose chosen this exact moment to make his food as well. I cant explain the amount of anger I felt. I literally just had to go back to my room and leave my food in the kitchen. I feel like a crazy person.
