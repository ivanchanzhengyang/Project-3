0,"New here, just curious about your opinions. Am I doing this right?","Hi all!

I'm a big guy, 6.4 feet, 240 pounds (I think, didn't weight myself for a few months) and done with my bad shape. My biggest problem is beers, especially in summer I drink almost daily a few beers and in the weekends even more.

I started IF 1,5 week ago now and I am curious if im doing things right. 

I installed Myfitnesspal for counting calories and 2100 is my daily goal to lose 1 pound a week. I eat dinner at 18.00 and eat breakfast the next day between 10.00 and 11.00, so thats 16-8/17-7 right?

My daily calorie intake is 1800 - 2000 and healthy, but the weekend is tough. I have kids who like to eat fastfood once a week and besides that I had 8 beers this weekend (way less then before, but still a lot), so the weekends I get above my goal (2400 and 2600 friday and saturday).

I sport like 2-3 times a week, tennis for at least 1 hour a time. 

So now you know my story I have a few questions:

1. Is it ok to have a few beers in the weekend? I want to lose weight but thinking about no alcohol anymore is tough, I really like my beer in the weekend (it's a bad habit, I know!). 
2. With IF 16-8 /17-7 I still have breakfast and lunch, do I need to skip a meal, or is it 'normal' to have breakfast and lunch?

Curious about your thoughts and advice! 

Cheers

1,IF 20:4 Working Out and Fasting Window,"Hello All,

Firstly, I am very glad we have a subreddit dedicated to this.

I am on a OMAD 20:4 regime at the moment. 

* My fasting window is between 3:30 PM - 7:30 PM. 
* I work out between 5AM - 8 AM depending on my work schedule and when I start work. I usually break my fast around 

&#x200B;

1. Is this regime fine? 
2. Does my feeding window *have* to be after my IF workout window **or** am I okay with this setup?

&#x200B;

I am worried I am working out and not in a fasted state suddenly even though it is normally 12 hours after my meal intake. 

&#x200B;

Appreciate the help and feedback from you all. Thanks :)",16nftnf,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16nftnf/if_204_working_out_and_fasting_window/,intermittentfasting
2,Who was the crazy black dude from years back?,"
Disclaimer: I’m not insinuating that intermittent fasting is crazy,  just that there was a crazy guy who also happened to intermittent fast.

I might’ve ran across this guy on YouTube in 2017. He was an older black man with a very weird manner of speaking.

- Very slow cadence, choice of words was odd and deliberate
- Says he eats nuts and berries once a day
- Claimed to be a doctor or something…
- might of been some stuff about anti-aging…

That’s all I can reliably remember. The guy who introduced me to him was kind of mental as well so I started getting cult vibes.

Only asking here because he presented as some sort of subject matter expert on fasting so thought he might have popped up in these circles.


P.S. It’s really scary to post something like this in a new sub because I have no idea what I’m in for.

Top 3 Predictions:

- “Never heard of him…”
- “Yeah, that guy was crazy! Here’s a link!” 
- “How dare you insult the trans-dimensional Messiah!”",16nfn7m,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16nfn7m/who_was_the_crazy_black_dude_from_years_back/,intermittentfasting

6,Why is it getting harder?,"Hi everyone,

New to IF, so be kind.

I started 16/8 about 10 days ago. The 7 days were easy, no issues with hunger or fatigue, in fact, i felt incredible.

Jump to Day 10 and that's all changed. I feel groggy, tired, a little sad and constantly hungry. What's in the name of science is going on here?

My diet is fine (meal plans constructed by my PT) and I'm drinking about 3-4L of water a day (i live in a very hot country). I am overweight though, not sure if that's something to factor in?",16na7tq,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16na7tq/why_is_it_getting_harder/,intermittentfasting

10,"Fell off the wagon for 3 weeks, but it didn’t really matter.","I got a new job which is a totally different work schedule than I used to work. I’ve had to stay up very late for work some nights and I’m sleeping in later as a result. It really threw off my whole IF routine. I lost 60 pounds. Went from 235 to 175. Male 5 ‘8. I was eating anything and everything for the last 3 weeks. McDonald’s, donuts from the gas station, cereal with honey on it, processed foods. I started to feel bloated and could see my stomach pudging (not a word) out a little bit. 

After a few days of dreading getting back in the scale, I finally did and I had gained 7 pounds. I was at 182. However, a few days later, I got up and weighed myself again and was back in the 170’s. I’ve realized my body has adjusted to being smaller than it used to be. This has been all the encouragement I need to keep going with IF. I think we can get stuck in a rut when we start gaining a lot of weight back, and it becomes hard to get back into the routine. I’m not going to fall into the trap of gaining the weight back because I worked too hard for this.",16n8xzd,51,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16n8xzd/fell_off_the_wagon_for_3_weeks_but_it_didnt/,intermittentfasting

13,Electrolytes recommendations Netherlands,"Hello everyone,

I have been intermittent fasting (20/4) for weeks now and after reading a book (Fast like a girl) I wanted to work up to longer fasts and eventually do a 5 day long water fast.

I am looking for electrolytes recommendations easily available in The Netherlands that will not break a fast. Preferably one that is also affordable!! I’d love if it was available at common stores here, but I also do not mind ordering online.

EDIT: One that does not break ketosis, I am not doing this for weight loss, but for the health benefits from ketosis, autophagy, etc.",16n6kqt,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16n6kqt/electrolytes_recommendations_netherlands/,intermittentfasting
14,Looking for motivation,"I’ve been doing IF for 8 weeks, every day 20:4 or OMAD, eating about 1500 calories a day. I was so proud of myself I lost 16lbs and was seeing the changes in my body.

Then on Sunday I had friends over for game night and they brought snacks. I had planned for this and decided the game night snacks were my meal for the day. The next day I have all this extra food. I guess I just hate waste and so I decided using up the snacks would be my meal again.  

I’m so bummed out. I weighed myself yesterday and I had gained 6lbs in 48 hours. I decided to actually sit and work out the calories today and realized I have gone about 1000 over each day. I guess I just never realized how many calories were in chips and dip and muffins etc. 

I told myself it was okay, that it was probably just water weight and not real and so today I got back to my IF and have only eaten about 600 calories. But I weighed myself this evening and I’m still 3lbs heavier than I was before these snack fueled to days.

I guess I’m just mad at myself, and feel foolish I didn’t realize how easy it would be to eat too much even within my window if I’m eating highly calorific snacks. 

I won’t be doing this again obviously. Can anyone give me hope that I’ll lose this and get back on track again?",16n6e3o,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16n6e3o/looking_for_motivation/,intermittentfasting

20,Nutrition concerns 44M,"Hi all. 44M 6’2”  started 19:5 4 months ago at SW of 235. CW 216 and extremely happy with progress . Have now been doing mostly 20:4 with 3x week of volleyball for a total of 7.5hrs/week

Will power and mindset have never been this strong . The feeling is incredible of no longer be ashamed at looking at pictures of myself , wearing shirts that had not fit ever , etc 

New relationship with good looking woman is also a huge confidence boost 

My concern is that I am really never hungry . I don’t think I’m eating recommended calories of TDEE or % of protein . For example yesterday my only meal consisted of a 4 egg omelette  with veggies 

Is this ok? Metabolic wise will it cause any issues ?  Since I feel great , even doing lots of exercise , not seeing the downside . 

Scale is moving consistently , which is addictive, but I might be losing muscle as well .

Would like your opinions and advice

24,Grief and IF,"TW: DEATH OF A LOVED ONE


I’m few months into IF (mixture of 20:4 most weekdays, one 48-hr fast a week, and 16:8 on weekends) and was losing weight and keeping hunger at bay with ease. Unfortunately, my brother passed unexpectedly a week and a half ago, and I’ve been grappling with an unprecedented level of grief in the wake of this tragedy.

Rather than having lost my appetite, I am ravenous. My body feels heavy and exhausted and seems to constantly want to refuel — particularly with carbs. I’m trying to give myself grace, but I don’t want to fall into the trap of emotional eating or to undo the progress I’ve made thus far and in terms of my weight and relationship to food. 

Anyone else experience anything similar with grief and IF? Would appreciate any advice or perspectives you have to share.",16myize,12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16myize/grief_and_if/,intermittentfasting

47,First step of the journey,"In 18 months I managed to put on 32kg. My career changed from active to sedentary. My daily calorie intake became uncapped and untracked - having takeout 2-3x a week with many junk binges. I was drinking & snorting cocaine every weekend. Exercise became a past time for me. My mental health was declining rapidly. 

6 months ago I took the decision to quit alcohol and drugs. It wasn't easy, but over the past few months I've managed to land a job promotion, get healthier relationships with friends and family, my mental health is beconing much more consistent and more money has been saved. 

In those 6 months, I started couch to 5k app, been on various hikes, started pilates and also started going the gym a tiny amount - those healthier habits are certainly forming. The one problem I have is emotional eating, the urge to binge at night mixed with my lack of discipline meant I've only managed to lose 3.5kg over the last 3 months of actively trying to lose weight. 

Now it's time to undo the 18months worth of neglect to my body by kicking my effort up a gear. Today was the day I started IF to further my progress. I've done it in the past with great success - the difference this time is my partying behaviour will not be disrupting my streaks, momentum and progress. 

For the first time in a while my mind has been quiet, content in knowing that I've started a journey which will make my goals become reality. 

CW: 104.5kg
GW: 85kg

Methods to reach my goals:

-18:6 and longer fasts 
- Calorie Deficit
- 3-5x Gym a week 
- 1-2x cardio per week (at least one run) 
- 1x Pilates session per week
- Aim towards 70k steps a week 
(this level of activity will be achieved methodically and slowly to prevent burnout) 


Hopefully the structure of IF will also help improve my discipline, focus and drive. Since its been years since I have done IF, I would really appreciate if people can share the benefits that they've personally felt when sticking with IF long-term. Also any tips and tricks would also be welcome, especially from those who have made similiar life changes.

49,Title: Intermittent Fasting: When Should I Eat If I'm Not Feeling Hungry?,"

Hey everyone,

I've been experimenting with intermittent fasting 16/8 and have a question that I hope some of you could shed some light on. So, here's the thing: I don't really feel hungry during my fasting window. The only time I start to feel hungry or get hunger cues is when I actually break my fast and start eating. I normally sleep around 12-1 am

For example, yesterday, I didn't eat until 2 p.m. because that's when I felt like I needed to eat, but I wasn't actually hungry. Today was the same story, but I didn't eat until 6 p.m. Again, no real hunger cues until I actually started eating.

Is this normal? Should I be eating at a certain time even if I don't feel hungry? Or should I just listen to my body and eat when I feel like it's time to eat, even if that means skipping the ""traditional"" meal times?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences.

Thanks!",16m7xdr,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16m7xdr/title_intermittent_fasting_when_should_i_eat_if/,intermittentfasting
50,I just might do it,"Feels like I’ve been trying to lose the same 15 pounds for YEARS. Now my wedding is three weeks away and as of this morning, I’m only 6.6 pounds away from my goal! I’m excited and it feels reachable for the first time in a very long time! I’m short and didn’t have a ton to lose in the first place so 5 pounds makes a significant difference in how my clothes fit, etc. I should add that I absolutely don’t think anyone *needs* to lose weight for their wedding, it’s just been the thought of a big event coming up that has been really helpful for my motivation! 

I mostly do 18/6. I think focusing on reducing glucose spikes has been really helpful for me - starting meals with veggies, taking ACV, and using my muscles somehow shortly after eating. I still drink a fair amount of alcohol 😑 but that’s a conversation for another time, and I actually have been able to cut back recently! I’ve been working out some, just lifting free weights mostly.

51,"Are there any concerns with metabolism ""slowing down"" with such little eating?","Title.

Been on IF for about 6 weeks now, but I can't help but wonder if I'm causing my metabolism to slow down. OMAD and 2MAD seems like it could possible cause issues long-term as far as metabolism goes

Wouldn't the body just ""turn down"" your metabolism in response to the drastically reduced calorie intake? 

I can already tell my bowel movements are way way down ever since starting this. Previously I would go poop about once a day or once every other day (when I used to eat standard 3 meals a day and 2100-2500 calories). Now I only seem to poop twice a week with the IF regimen (1 or 2 meals a day, 1400-1500 calories)

Anyways, I was just wondering about this, if there is a ""correct"" way to do this without your metabolism slowing down it would be good to know for a newbie

...or is a slowing metabolism only a concern if you go, say, a few days without eating? I still eat every day, just fewer calories and usually only 1 or 2 meals a day (as per most of the ""before and after"" success story posts on here)",16m727w,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16m727w/are_there_any_concerns_with_metabolism_slowing/,intermittentfasting

55,Am i hurting my body by continuing OMAD on cardio heavy days?,"Hello everyone, im currently on week 3 or 4 (not rly sure when i started) and i lost +\_ 15lbs.

I noticed im very tolerant to hunger, or better yet, seeing the progress im making makes arguing against eating very easy.

I started with 18:6 then switched to OMAD.  
I don't track what or how much i eat but i try to eat at the same time every day.   
Lunch is at a cafeteria where you can choose from 2 courses, not a whole bunch but its cooked food and generally pretty tasty.  
It usually consist of some type vegetable soup/broth and some meat (pork/chicken, be it grilled or with sauce or in a stew) and some sides like potato, carrot, peas.

The portion size is normal and i feel satisfied for 6-8 hours before i start to hunger.

Im having a pretty cardio intensive training two times a week and up until now i used to have a 2nd meal on these days (18:6). Now im thinking to stick to OMAD on these days as well.  


Despite the fact that i feel great every day, i can't help but feel that i'm overdoing this fasting thing and depriving my body of what it needs to be healthy.  
Am i bombing my body too hard by sticking to OMAD on the heavy workout day?

61,Thoughts after my second week of intermittent fasting.,"Hi All!

As promised I am back with my week 2 update and it has been a fascinating experience. You can see my [week 1 update here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16ezz34/thoughts_after_my_first_week_of_intermittent/) 

**Structure:**

This is unchanged from last week. 

My goal is to lose weight.

My plan is to start fasting after my evening meal (usually between 7-9pm) and fast until 12.00 the next day. This gives an average fast window of 16 hours.

During my fasting window I drink water and black coffee. When I break the fast, I eat what I want and track my calories.

I weigh myself first thing in the morning and am tracking a weekly average.

As yet I have not taken a cheat day but intend to do so when the new routine beds in.

**Observations:**

My main takeaway this week is how much stress is an eating trigger for me. My amazing wife has been away enjoying a well deserved break with some friends leaving me as child-wrangler-in chief. The energy it takes to get them up, fed, the animals done, and the girls out of the door to school on my own in the morning has made sticking to my fast trickier than last week. 

Funny thing is, as soon as my children are at school the urge to eat fades and I am absolutely fine until midday. No doubt that the morning stress makes things harder. 

Also, I have noticed how long it takes my stomach to register food. It seems it can be up to an hour after breaking my fast until I register the food and feel satiated. This is way longer than the conventional wisdom of 15-20 min. 

This I think ties in with the fact that I am consuming a very large lunch as my first meal of the day, probably larger than I needed. When I try and scale it back to a more typical portion I have to keep myself occupied for up to an hour after eating for the urge to eat more to pass. 

I am going to focus on more mindful, slower eating to see if this helps. 

My sleep has been a bit more disrupted this week. I have had a couple of 5 am starts as I woke up early and can't get back to sleep due to hunger. 

The gentle downward trend for my weight continues and I have seen a 2lb drop on the scales so far. This is less than I would have hoped, but it feels a natural and sustainable process. 

There have also been NSV, I have lost a little girth around my stomach and arms. 

**Conclusion:**

I am excited for week three. 

Of all the benefits of fasting, the most surprising have been the insights it has given me in to my relationship with food. ""Hunger"" means a lot more than ""I need sustenance"" it seems. 

Trimming down the amount I eat in my eating window is the big challenge for the next seven days but there is a line to walk between aiding weight loss and making the fasting impossible to follow. 

One final bit of info, I am planning my first cheat day for this Friday. [Looking forwards to a good breakfast.](https://media.tenor.com/LirNnozCxscAAAAC/food-breakfast.gif)

62,First week done - yay!,"I've just finished my first week of IF and I am really pleased with how it has gone. 

For background, I am 38F, 5'8"", SW: 300lb, pre-diabetic and high cholesterol (both good and bad). I decided to try and start with 16:8, but actually I have done a mix of 20:4, OMAD and 19:5 because it just fell that way. I've not got a GW in mind as it feels so far away and unobtainable right now that I don't want to obsess over a number I won't have seen for 20+ years. 

I haven't changed much about what I eat yet, though I am trying to reduce my carbs. I've done keto in the past and enjoyed it but found the prep too much and unsustainable in the longer term, though I wonder if it might be easier with IF because there is less to prep. 

I'm drinking plenty of water, have come down 7lbs already, and trying to be sensible with what I am eating. I'm not counting calories as such, but popping some stuff into My Fitness Pal to check in and make sure I'm not going overboard. I will also look to reduce my carb intake soon (keto and I got on well previously, until the prep became unsustainable). 

I'm struggling to get an accurate TDEE as another poster recently put up, so I am going for around 1,500 cals at the moment and seeing how I feel.

65,"36 of involuntary fasting ""reset"" my gut bacteria, IBS under control now (gross warning)","Background: 34 year old male. I had always been the skinny guy so I could get away with eating anything for the longest time. About five years ago I began to have really bad bowel movements. I think this was the poor diet finally catching up. It got to a point where I had to plan my day around my expected bathroom visits. I couldn't go on extended trips and generally felt really embarrassed about how long it took to shit and how it never felt that I actually completed. At some point someone recommended digestive enzymes which helped tremendously, however, if I didn't take the pill just once my symptoms immediately returned. 

Involuntary fast: Last week I ate something risky that had been sitting in my fridge for a few days. A couple hours later I began to feel nauseous, then later into the night the diarrhea began, and it did not stop. I barely got any sleep because every couple of hours I had to get up, sit on the toilet for a good 20-25 minutes then tried to fall asleep before I had to go again. The body aches soon followed, it seemed to traverse my body, starting with a headache, then my upper back, midsection, and finally my legs and feet. 

The following day was an improvement but still miserable. I had zero energy, only getting out of bed to use the restroom. In the evening I did consume a couple of electrolytes. This helped with energy. The second night was the last of it, low energy but symptoms had mostly subsided. 

Aftermath: The morning after I felt just fine. I was not hungry at all, but decided I should probably eat something. It's been about 10 days and my bowel movements have returned to the way they were five years prior. There has even been a couple of instances where after I finished, I wiped and there was nothing to wipe. It honestly feels weird not having to sit on the toilet for 15-20 minutes at a time.

Now I'm no doctor and I am certainly not giving medical advice here, but I do believe the combination of fasting and massive, unstoppable diarrhea did something positive to my digestive track. Basically I think it flushed out all of the nasty, harmful bacteria.",16loaum,185,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16loaum/36_of_involuntary_fasting_reset_my_gut_bacteria/,intermittentfasting

I change up my eating times and have occasional days where I may only do 18:6.  I do an occasional extended fast to help with some digestive issues.  My problem is that I find that apps that calculate my needed calorie intake have always been way off.  Even at my heaviest I didn’t consume the amount of calories they say I should be eating.  So I really don’t know how many to add back to my diet to maintain once I reach my goal weight.  Also, how much of a cushion did you give yourself for loss/gain?

While I still am on the same journey, I’m also working minimally to lose weight. I got sick of buying new crappy clothes because of the weight gain (which was 90% due to a medication). I don’t count cals, I haven’t been exercising, and I don’t worry about what I’m going to eat. I just fast until either 12-4 everyday and stop eating after dinner. I’ve been amazed how consistent the results have been, and how easy it’s been to not snack in the evenings. I also stopped drinking last December since I was having digestive concerns, and now when I try to drink I feel sick 🤢 (I feel like if I was still drinking it would be harder? Idk). I do try to make sure I have 2L of water daily (sparkling water) because I feel better.",16l50lg,256,8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16l50lg,intermittentfasting
85,9 months into IF,"SW: 185/190(?) CW: 156~ GW: about 135'ish F/61 5'4"".

Started this journey Dec 2022...and despite HUGE life change (beloved, my champion  for IF, passing - yes, I keep bringing this up, but there is a point), I've kept with it.

I do 16:8 most days, and due to work load, have touched on 20:4 once about every 2 weeks. I've NOT been totally strict...I've had cheat days but only lasting about a day.  I tend to eat pretty healthy, I do have my evening wine, strive to drink 1/2 my weight in H2O daily & have bullet coffee (coffee & a bit of butter/ghee...it's dirty).

Exercise - main form is getting 10K steps/daily, body weight workouts & mat pilates...breathing exercises as well (I smoke organic tobacco)...inhale 4 counts, hold 6 counts, exhale 8 counts.

Main take-aways: better sleep! Loser clothes (shopping spree anyone?!), increased energy.

Also, my point from above: Caretaking takes a toll on one, mentally, emotionally & physically.  Beloved was keen on me getting back to caring for myself as he was, ironically, actually getting better as far as tumors reducing. He was so into IF when I started that he did 90% of the reseach for me 💖.  And he was proud of my progress.  And he did the meal planning based on his research 💖💖. IF has been a key component for me to muddle through being separated from my bestie, my love & husband. I  struck with it, not just for myself, but for him too...anything less would be a diservice to his support, encouragement & total acceptance.  And this community has been been such a great support...I thank you all & love you all beyond words.

I feel overall better when my stomach is empty, but being in the moment of eating feels good until afterwards. There have been times when I'm trying to fast, but I can't resist the cravings, so I end up getting something to eat, overeating, then feel extremely guilty about it afterwards.

96,Crashing hard (and suddenly) in the afternoons,"I’ve tried to start IF a bunch of times, but I can’t seem to make it work. 39F, 215lbs, fibromyalgia, PCOS, depression and anxiety.

I’ve never had a problem skipping breakfast, so I thought it would make sense to do something like 16:8 with the window from noon to 8pm.  Thing is, no matter what I eat at noon, or even if I wait and eat a bit later than noon, by 4pm it all falls apart.  I suddenly get sweaty, shaky, and dizzy.  I can’t think straight, and I feel weak.  My skin feels like it’s frost bitten, burning but cold.  I feel like I have to eat something or I’ll black out, but then I can’t stop myself from eating more, and usually like a toddler; I just stuff food into my face, even if I’m waiting for something else to cook.  It happens really fast, going from feeling fine to feeling like I’m about to fall over.  

I’ve tried grazing after lunch on nuts or veggies to keep my blood sugar from tanking, drinking more water, drinking coffee or tea instead, even spoonfuls of straight peanut butter, but nothing seems to help.

It's not a taste issue - I drank black coffee for most of my teens and 20s. But since having a kid, I can do a day or two of black coffee but then I start getting terrible stomach pain.

I know that technically speaking, adding milk to coffee will break my fast, but I'm wondering if anyone has any alternatives or suggestions - or just encouragement. Will this just not work for me, or can I fudge a little in the mornings with a tbsp of skim and still see benefits?

Hello everyone!

I've been on an intermittent fasting routine for a while now, and although I've been eating what I consider to be healthy and fulfilling foods, I found myself feeling hungry all day no matter what I ate. Any idea why? normally I eat between 2 and 10pm, today I started at 12 to 8pm

My Stats:

* **Total Calories Consumed**: 2100
* **Calorie Budget**: 2000
* **BMR**: 1900

What I Ate:

* **Carrots, Medium**: 150 grams, 62 cal
* **Chicken Breast, Skinless, Cooked**: 3 ounces, 140 cal
* **Dolsi Ice Cream (Diet)**: 110 cal
* **Greek Yogurt, Plain, Nonfat**: Individual portion, 180 cal
* **Mango**: 400 grams, 260 cal ( I coudn't resist and ate it all lol)
* **Pasta Salad with Chicken**: 400 grams, 408 cal
* **Rice, White, Basmati, Cooked**: 200 grams, 258 cal
* **Freekeh with Chicken Breast**: 250 grams, 350 cal

What I Drank:

* **Bear Brand Powdered Milk**: 3 tablespoons, 113 cal
* **Ayran Full Fat Yogurt**: 150 ml, 100 cal
* **Coffee-Mate Creamer**: 6 tablespoons, 120 cal
* 2.5 liters Water 0

(I want to go slow and gradual, deficit target is 500 cal as a cycle for 14km each day. The budget iseven above my BMR, so I'm puzzled as to why I'm still hungry. Is it the types of foods I'm eating? Or is there something I'm not aware of that might be causing this lingering hunger? I thought it was water but I drank a lot and I still got hungry. I'm craving sugar and fat right now lol

123,Electrolyte confusion,"Ugh!
Upped my IF schedule from one 24hr fast per week to 36hr (last meal Thursday night and break the fast Saturday) per week. The added 12hrs has been a boon to my IF/weight/fitness goals. Up to today I’ve been strict zero food with nothing but plain water, plain carbonated water, black coffee or green tea during the fast. 

What I had not considered (and I take full responsibility for this oversight on my part) was the electrolyte deficiency. I know…I should have known better. In my feeble defense, I truly didn’t feel anything super off whilst doing 24hr. But 36hrs is a whole other beast. The muscle cramps and spasms especially are no bueno. Never mind the other symptoms that come with it. 

So I did the google search and landed on Simply Primals’ Waterfast electrolyte supplement but now I’m second guessing the purchase based on the ingredients. I see natural flavorings (beaver butt juice) and rebaudioside A (Stevia leaf extract) among the other ingredients, which makes me think this stuff could induce insulin and I won’t go into ketosis and see the fat loss I really am aiming for. (I am finally seeing some striations, definition and veins!) Drinking it, it has lemony flavor with a slight thick aftertaste. 

So I come to this page and those who are most likely way smarter/knowledgeable than myself on this stuff. 

What gives? Trying to stave off the cramps and other nasty side effects with the electrolyte deficiency whilst staying healthy and take full advantage of the IF benefits.

125,17/7 IF and protein intake,"I've been doing IF 17/7 for for almost 23 months, in a caloric deficit or maintenance. My goal of doing this was originally to burn fat, then for recomposition.

Right now my calories are 2100/day, doing 40% protein, 30% carbs, 30% fats. So that's about 200 grams of protein, 150 grams of carbs, and 70 grams of fats. I'm an otherwise very healthy person. Am I missing anything regarding my calories and macros? Am I getting too much protein for a 7 hour eating window?

Anyone using something that is low calorie to try to minimize disrupting my fast? Again, no sugar, just looking to lighten the color so it looks like what I'm used to and takes just a touch softer. The more natural, the better.

EDIT: Just to add a bit, I'm mainly doing 17/7 IF, some days its 16/8, some days I go even longer.

UPDATE: Tried Nut Pods, no way this can possibly fulfill the place of Half & Half. I used 2 tablespoons and it added some flavor, but gave the coffee a new edge that wasn't pleasant. To get it to the color of what 2 TBSP of Half & Half, I'd probably need 3-4+ TBSP worth and calorie wise I'm basically back to Half & Half.  I used Califia unsweetened creamer in the past with decent results. I may try that or a few of the other suggestions here, or, just stick to Half & Half.

129,Wildly varying TDEE calculators,"Hi everyone, I’ve been doing ADF for 4 months now. Weight loss has slowed but I haven’t been too concerned because of my age and because there’s still a downward trend with both measuring tape and scale. But tonight I decided to double-check my TDEE, just for the hell of it. I’ve been working off a 2,700 cal TDEE (yes, it’s a lot, because you know – obesity) and the variations were absolutely wild. They went all the way down to 2,200 cal, and all the way up to 3,000 cal. Insane. 

Part of this is, I think, the vague definition of exercise. Most have a “light”, “medium”, and “active” classification for how many times a week you exercise, but no mention of time or intensity for each session. So what gives? And more importantly, how can I accurately measure my TDEE?

136,To those who feel that you've lost the game.,"Hello once again everybody!

Around a week ago, I made post on ""what do you do, when you're ill?"".

After my week of getting better and decidedly getting ""off"" from my IF schedule (16:8), I had taken a step back when I stepped on to the scale.. +2,5kg ( +5.5lbs). A small number considering my scope and my starting weight ( 139.4 kg/307.3lbs), yet I felt devastated.. I knew that I was in a better condition in regards to the cold/fever I had, but that didn't make me feel even slightly better. I was (mentaly) down. 

I weigh myself every Friday first thing in the morning and that Friday, without any drama or doubt made a simple yet very, very effective decision: I just started again.

""woohoo... That's what you are supposed to do"". Yeah you're right, but I think I'm not the only one who get's discouraged by setbacks and ""failures"". 

""But it's a part of a journey"". This is very true, yet the timing could be bad for you if you've made progress and then your car breaks down. There is the feeling of uncertainty that set's in and it's logically understandable, since you can't ever be sure if that was it. Is it easier to walk back to the start line since it's the shorter trip and probably: even easier. Since after all, you didn't get that far from the get go. Doing the rest of the way on foot seems to take forever..

We'll I decided to fix the so called car.

Now, after not doing anything out of the normal (in regards to my IF plan) I'm back on track.

This morning I stepped on the scale once again. My initial thoughts before stepping on that scale we're: ""I've probably stayed on the same number as last week, and that would be fine since at least I wasn't going to be heavier, hopefully"".

The scale gave me my answer: 133.4kg (294 lbs).

Not only had I not gained anything, but I had went down 3.5kg (7.7lbs).

I could not be happier!

Now I've finally understood and internalized the meaning of a journey. I knew what it ment before, but I had not understood it. 

So to EVERY ONE of YOU: YOU CAN DO THIS! YOU ARE NOT ONLY THE ""SCORE"" YOU GET WITH EACH WEIGH IN, YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. YOU CAN PUSH IT, YOU CAN MAKE IT. I, AND ALL OF US IN HERE BELIEVE IN: YOU! 

Thanks again to everybody here that have helped me and who have given your support to a guy like me who didn't believe in himself after all the backfires and all the ups and downs. 

This truly is a journey, The BEST journey and I'm so thankful that I can share it with you all.

Take care and all the love!",16j3tz1,63,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16j3tz1/to_those_who_feel_that_youve_lost_the_game/,intermittentfasting

7.45pm: Post meal blood sugar 4.1 mmol/L

8.45pm: Post meal blood sugar 5.9 mmol/L

Also, I go to gym at 6AM for 1.5 hours of workout. 

I will try to hit a protein target of 180 grams/day and sleep target of 7 hours.

163,I began OMAD five days ago and haven't had a decent night's sleep since.,"I recently went from eating 3+ meals per day to OMAD and have mostly been feeling great. I've noticed raised energy levels, minimal hunger pangs, increased productivity, less bloating, etc. However there is one unexpected downside...I can't seem to stay asleep. One minute I am freezing and then I am burning up. There is no fever. I am also just RESTLESS. Tossing and turning all night whereas before I would sleep relatively soundly. I usually eat my meal anytime from 12-3 and go to bed around 11. I do not feel hungry at night nor do I consume caffeine past 4. My dog and I exercise together by going on morning runs. The rest of my day is fairly active.

166,Planning a 72-Hour Sole Water Fast—Advice on Breaking the Fast Before Bed?,"Hi everyone,

I'm planning to start a 72-hour sole water fast this Sunday night at 8pm and will end it on Wednesday evening at 8pm. I have experience with fasting and have completed 60-hour fasts before, but this will be my first 72-hour fast. I'm looking for advice on how to break the fast safely and effectively.

Would it make sense to stretch the fast to the next morning? If not, what types of food would be best to consume that evening before going to bed? I know the importance of reintroducing foods gently after an extended fast, so I'd love to hear any recommendations or personal experiences you all have.

173,How Do You Eat Enough Calories?,"I'm doing a combination of OMAD and alternate day fasting where I basically one meal every other day and make it as large as I can, calorically speaking. However, on the days I eat I cannot seem to get enough calories into my body to compensate for the days I'm fasting without eating junk. I usually make it to the neighborhood of 2,250 kilocalories to 2,750 kilocalories, sometimes pushing to 3,000. But it's rare I get that high.

Over the past week, I've been averaging under 1,200 kilocalories a day. Even eating ad libatum on my eating days. That's like saying I've been eating 2,400 kilocalories every other day, which is probably about right. That's too low for me. So my question is, how do I plow more food down my gullet? I need to be averaging somewhere closer to 1,500 kilocalories a day, including fasting days. And that's still a 900+ kilocalorie deficit based the rate of my weight loss and my calories tracked over the past few months (TDEE ~ 2,430

EDIT: Please stop suggesting that I eat more fat. I'm eating 50-60% fat, 30-35% protein, and only about 10% from carbs. I don't think I can increase my fat any more while still hitting my protein target and I've also said multiple times in the comments that I'm already eating a ton of healthy fats.",16i3cks,9,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16i3cks/how_do_you_eat_enough_calories/,intermittentfasting

Of COURSE on Monday I woke up 5 pounds heavier...to make all that progress and then mess it up during 1 day of binging just makes me feel so awful.

185,Difference in how men treat me.,"Ever since I (F29) lost significant weight thanks to IF! I noticed how people treat me has changed especially men. Not that it matters but I noticed a drastic change. 

Usually I don’t like the attention and I’m very shy and introverted person,I rather be invisible if I’m being honest and that’s how I pretty much was treated it never bothered me. 

Anyways I noticed men have been smiling more at me especially when I’m using the subway, coffee shops, in the park at the gym. A random man saving a seat for me in the crowded train despite being one of the last to enter the train. 

I was at the coffee shop the other day and the barista gave me a free coffee I thought it was random and didn’t think much of it. I went to an ice cream shop and the man behind the counter insisted I try every flavour before I picked a flavour and gave me an extra scoop. Btw it was delicious. 

This feels all new to me I don’t know how to feel or react obviously I’m grateful and I’m not complaining it’s just things I’ve noticed since losing weight.

However I want to do a longer 2 or 3 day fast now and move towards more and longer fasting.  Because I'm 82 I asked my doctor for advice and someone to monitor me and he looked at me in horror.

So I found a nutritionist in my health care plan and set up an appointment.  She is not part of the IA community and will probably be suspicious and hostile to any concept of fasting.    What I want is more structure in what I eat, to keep it balanced and feed my microbiome and get all the stuff I need.  And keep on doing IF of course.  What would be the best approach you think ?

So my 16:8 is more like a 17:7 or an 18:6. 

Some nights, I play tennis late, around 8/9 pm, and I feel fine. On some mornings (not the ones after a tennis night, mind you), I do Zone 2 on my elliptical for about 60 mins. The machine says I burn about 600 cal but I don't know how accurate that is.

My question is about that zone 2 exercise. I do that around 5.30 in the morning and then I don't eat until 12.30 or so. Is this okay? It is good, like I hope, or is this unhealthy or even dangerous?

205,Why was I not enlightened about IF earlier?!?,"I’m a 52 year old male.  I was in fantastic shape in my 20’s and then over the years, my weight fluctuated, but steadily increased the past 25 years.  

I’ve had a few health issues the last 10 years.  I had chronic myeloid leukemia, but it’s been undetectable for the last 7 years. So while that’s no longer a scare, my weight has caused other issues - hypertension, scary blood tests associated with my liver, and so many aches and pains (including plantar fasciitis), making exercise a royal pain in the ass. I’ve been feeling like crap for a long time. Well, my last blood test (checking for leukemia and other issues), I noticed my blood sugar was through the roof. Two months ago, I found out that I now have type 2 diabetes.

I immediately knew that enough was enough.  I have a 7 year old son who I love with all my heart and I want to be around for him! I started eating sensibly and decided to try intermittent fasting (16:8).  It’s been nearly 2 months and I’ve only broken my fast a little early several times (I’m mostly 16-18 hrs).  I have never once broken my fast with any of those late night snacks that was part of my “previous life.” It’s like a game and I refuse to break my streak.  Within the first 3 days of IF, cutting out the crap I typically ate and replacing it with more plant-based foods, my energy levels increased immensely.  I was able to exercise.  Swelling and overall inflammation decreased.  My plantar fasciitis was manageable. And the weight is shedding!

Almost two months ago (July 20th), I started at my all-time worst, at 333 lbs. (6’2”) and I’m now down to 298 lbs.  I’m all in now.  I feel great!

217,Seeking Advice for my Wife who has Hyperthyroidism,"Hi!

My (32) Wife (F33) and I have been doing 16:8 IF since 3 weeks. Last year december we both decided to go vegan and about two months ago we allowed cheese back into our lives. Just the lifestyle change had me lose 12kgs (26lbs) naturally, without any regard to when or what I eat, other than it being vegan. 

Since I started IF 3 weeks ago, I've lost another 6kgs (13lbs), so it's working really well for me! I'm 1,97m (6,4) tall and weighed 142kgs (313lbs) in December 2022, right now I'm at 124kgs (273lbs)

My Wife is 1,76m (5,7) tall and she weighed 111kgs (244lbs) in December. She hasn't had the same progress since going vegan/vegetarian or starting IF. Now she weighs 109kgs (240lbs) so not even IF has done anything for her in the past 3 weeks. She is understandably frustrated, that I'm having such an easy time and she is seemingly completely stuck. 

I have to add- we make sure to have a fairly decent diet. We cook fresh daily, lots of vegetables and almost no dairy or meat replacement products. Very seldomly Soda, no sugar in the coffee and generally lots of water. I don't really see that she's doing anything differently than me. 

She was diagnosed with hashimoto, so an auto-immune disease with hyperthyroidism about 2.5 years ago during the pregnancy of our child. Since then she's been getting Euthyrox for her disease. 

Has anyone got any experiences with IF, diet and generally losing weight and Hyperthyroidism. 

She has her next appointment with the internal specialist in November and she'll definetly bring it up with her. We are also thinking of seeking the help of a dietician. 

Would greatly appreciate and advice you can give! Thank you :)",16h0dc1,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16h0dc1/seeking_advice_for_my_wife_who_has_hyperthyroidism/,intermittentfasting

226,Connection between IF and blood sugar,"i started at 12 hours (about 8 years ago) back then i weighted around 75kg and it went to to 65kg. But last year i change it to 18 hours. The reason why i increased my IF was because i had an ACL. Doc said it would be better I'm ""lighter"" as it will put less strain on my knees. Although 18 hours is rare, but the 12 hours is always a hit. For the past 9 days, i've been going more than 18 hours. I've stopped timing myself but rather just eat whenever i'm hungry. So its just usually one meal per day but i do drink water the whole time.

My only problem now is i get sleepy even if i have more than enough sleep the prior day. I'm thinking that maybe my blood sugar is too low? If this is true, then how do you overcome this? Would love to hear your thoughts.

If it matters, I'm 165cm. Small built, most of the excess weight is around my belly, neck and face. My waist has gone from 37 to 32.

Nothing really big just watching what I eat making sure I get plenty of protein and healthy fats. Occasional cheat days but I feel that’s good so my body doesn’t get too used to being this weight. 

Although the scale stopped moving for August, and I’m sure it has to do with a few reasons.

229,Thomas DeLauer: 17 Cardinal Rules for Fat Loss with Intermittent Fasting,"Hey all, I was a little confused from some of the points Thomas listed and talked about in this latest video of his and was hoping to clear up some of the confusion. 

Let me stary by saying is that I'm an avid follower of Thomas and his work and how I got introduced to IF. 

Some of the points I don't understand are:

1. Fast less frequently than more frequently - for example, of the 7 days of the week, he says you should be fasting for a max of 3 days and then obviously not fasting the other 4. I thought I've heard him say in the past to fast no more than 3-5 days of the week, but now he's saying no more than 3. For me at least, fasting Monday to Friday was perfect, and then I wouldn't fast on the weekends, but still eat in a calorie deficit. So what's wrong exactly with going 5 days max and not 3?

2. Eat more on the days you don't fast - So here he says on his non-fasting days, he actually eats in a slight deficit (who knows how much of a calorie surplus that would be) and then on fasting days in a drastic deficit. To me, it just seems a little risky in the sense that you may not be in a net calorie deficit by the end of the week. You'd really have to make sure you calorie tracking is on point if you're gonna eat in a slight surplus 4 days of the week but deficit for the 3 other. Not saying it can't be done, but I just don't understand the benefit here besides what Thomas says is to keep the metabolism elevated. 

3. Take 2-week breaks from fasting - He means this more as a diet break kind of thing, but he didn't mention how often you should do it and eat at mantience or better. If I eat at mantience for 2 weeks, how am I gonna lose fat? Maybe I'm wildly missing something here, but that's what I understood. 

Again, not trying to bash Thomas here or saying that he's wrong on any of these, just trying to clear up my confusion around these 3 points. If anyone here happens to have done any of the 3, please feel free to share your experiences below.

232,"I broke my fast early, but it’s ok!","I’m still very new to IF. I’ve been doing it for a little over 3 weeks now, mostly pretty successfully. I don’t have a strict eating window as my days fluctuate greatly, the only thing I try to do is fit a daily fast minimum of 14 hours. Most of the time though I push it 16-18.

Anywho, last night when I woke up, I felt what I considered a ravenous hunger. Usually the type of hunger when I finally hit around the 15-16 hr mark into my fast, but it has been only 10 hours. I tried sipping on some water and whatnot, but I couldn’t overcome it and had a bit of a snack of epic proportions (I’ll spare any triggering details).

At first this greatly upset me. I was doing so well, about 21 days of “perfect adherence”. I lost about 9-10 pounds, I was on top of the world and I ruined it!

I did some reflection about it this morning though, and I figured it’s not the end of the world. After deliberation, I’ve concluded that the only thing that happened was that my eating window opened early and will be extended by 4 hours for today. I am going to eat normally when I am hungry and just close again when I get to around a usual time I try to close my eating window.

I am not a failure. We are not failures. I got this. We got this.

My questions are:

* I understand we eat during the non fasting period also matters. However how much diff does it make to eat whatever ones does, whether in OMAD or paced out? 

* Does it matter if my IF hours vary per day or if i take non IF days in between?

* Do we really need to fast for days to get the autophagy kicking in?

I want to loose about 50 pounds in total and want to avoid loose skin as much as is possible.

251,I made a free fitness app for those who struggle to follow workout programs,"For nearly ten years, I've been committed to pushing my limits and improving my strength and endurance. My biggest takeaway? A well-planned workout routine is key. Whether you're browsing through r/fitness or r/WorkoutRoutines, it's clear that everyone values a solid workout program, and many free ones are available.

However, there's a catch - these programs are often in spreadsheets or PDFs. That's not exactly user-friendly, especially when you're trying to navigate a workout at the gym on your smartphone. I've even tested apps like Strong, but they lack features such as adaptable exercise progressions and weight tracking.

That's when I decided, enough was enough. Together with a colleague, I embarked on a journey to create a solution - FitXtreme. Our goal? Make top-notch challenging workouts easily accessible, so users can build a fitness routine and achieve their goals. We wanted to create a central hub for all workouts.

We collaborated with a UX designer to ensure a user-friendly app interface and began digitizing popular free workout programs. And the best part? You don't need any equipment.

262,Benefits of going 20:4 over 16:8?,"Hello everyone, a little bit about myself, 31m. 5'6"" 178lbs. Been trying to lose weight and get in shape over the last 2 years with no real plan or structure. Started going to the gym and whilst it did improve my life quite a bit, i didn't manage to lose a single lb, stuck at 187lb for the past 5 years.  
Unintentionally i started doing what i later learned was IF.   
I started by having lunch and dinner at the same time every day while also heavily cutting dinner portion size. Then i learned there's a name for this and there are some other aspects i can consider to make it more efficient.  
Now i'm down 9lb on day 8 of my IF and it feels like cheating.

Been mostly doing 18:6 but i can easily manage 20:4 and i even had a 36h fast over the weekend.  
Immediate benefits:  
I feel very good about the progress i'm making (which probably leads to the rest of these positive feelings)  
More energy during the day + i don't feel like passing out after lunch   
Better gym performance (and no more weird gastric reflux when the cardio gets intense).  
Better sleep at night (i go to bed more tired and fall asleep easier).  
Pants are way more comfortable lol.

Cons: The longer i go without food, the less i want to eat food. It got to the point i had to ""force"" myself to have a meal on the weekend just so i don't nuke my body with too much IF from the start.  


I have a few questions if any of you are so kind:  


What are the risks of going hard on IF and how do i know if im missing something in my diet?   
Maybe some suggestions of healthy foods you guys eat (not recipes).

In theory, is OMAD more efficient for losing weight than 18:6 or 20:4 provided i would eat the same amount of food in one sitting as opposed to two meals?

Is this weight loss linear (in theory) or will there be plateaus where i have to change things up?

Thanks and happy fasting :D

So far it's been going great. It took some getting used to, but I barely feel hungry on fasting days. I really don't want to screw this up.

That said, I need to start exercising again. I've just moved back to my hometown and I was having trouble finding a gym. I just found one that's affordable and near my apartment.

Thing is, I'm scared that if I start exercising again, it's going to mess with my appetite and I'll find it harder to stick to the fasting routine.

Has anybody been through this? Is it better to exercise on fasting days or off days? I work 9-5 and I'm useless in the mornings, so I could only go to the gym at night or on weekends.

264,Fasting Windows / Late Dinner?,"So, I'm looking to start fasting 16:8 but I'm concerned because my fiancé and I sometimes have to work late, past 6pm eastern time, and most days we aren't eating dinner until 8 or even 9pm. I was watching a video from Mindy Pelz about optimizing our fasts to be starting to fast 2 hours before sunset because our melatonin will be higher at that time and we will be less insulin resistant/more fat burning zone. 

So, If I eat at 8pm and then fast from 9pm-1pm (16 hours), will I still be burning fat? Or because I have to eat later, I'll not be able get into a 'good' fast?

265,I have been following IF and lower carb dieting around a year or two. Having breathlessness after breaking the fast 8 hours earlier with a very high sugar meal. Help?,"I've  noticed this breathlessness previously, but less severe, even when  eating during my feeding window. I always just assumed it was my stomach  being a bit too full from sometimes eating a lot at once. Although I  generally stick to low carb and calorie restriction for my weight loss  goals, there have been cheat days where sometimes I'll consume a lot of  sugar from chocolate, ice cream and coke - foods i'd never normally eat.  I'll often feel breathlessness after eating this way, though I don't  eat this way very often, so it didn't happen much.

Something  really caught my attention lately. I stopped fasting, stopped dieting. I  wanted to increase carbs and eat earlier in the day. Instead of eating  through the evening, I shifted my eating 8 hours earlier, starting with a  600 calorie breakfast.

I made  that breakfast often be pancakes or oatmeal, covered in honey, often  with a banana. It's not the kind of meal I'd normally eat. It's low in  protein and fat, and extremely high in sugar. I try not to over do it  with the honey, but I think I often end up using too much. This means my  raw sugar intake in this meal is probably extremely high, paired with  very low protein and fat. So that's probably a huge amount of sugar  getting absorbed very quickly. I'd also normally be fasting at this  time, without any complaint from my body, so my body is 'tuned' I guess,  not to expect any food at this time.

Shortly  after having this meal, I have the most intense bouts of  breathlessness, and this typically lasts for around 3-4 hours. I now  know it's not my stomach being over full, because it was a smaller meal.

I've  had an ECG, they couldn't find anything wrong, blood pressure is good,  heart rate is typically about 50. I'm also experiencing intense  insomnia, which seems to have came on after I tried to stop my IF  routine and switch back to a regular meal pattern. The insomnia  intensified when I tried to resolve it, by upping my carbs and sugar  intake, in case low serotonin was the cause, but this has only made my  insomnia worse, and is leading to daily breathlessness.

I  wonder if, because I've trained my body to accept lower carb, with  higher fats and protein, as well as not expect food throughout the day,  that suddenly eating an extremely high sugar meal, especially during my  normal fasting period, is causing dysfunction? Either this, or there is  something actually wrong with me.

Anyone  have any ideas about this or experienced anything like it? I've been  looking into high blood sugar and breathlessness, as there seems to be a  clear link between having very high sugar meals and the onset of  breathlessness. I'm not diabetic, but I've ordered a blood glucose  monitor so I can check what's happening. Today I'm fasting again, as before, and my breathing is fine.",16ftleh,7,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16ftleh/i_have_been_following_if_and_lower_carb_dieting/,intermittentfasting
266,I can't seem to eat enough in the small window,"So for the last 3 weeks, i've been doing an 18:6 IF while eating 1200 calories and no exercise with an office job. For context i'm 35M 5'7"" (170cm) 177?lbs (80.5kg) looking to lose lots of fat. And so far i was feeling great and down 5kg.
Everyone gave me advise saying i should eat at least 1500 calories and exercise.

Well today was my first day trying to eat 1500 and also a small strength training session to try and ease into it..
I got to 1320cal and have been so full i almost feel sick. I actually couldn't eat my dinner until about 19:30 and i'm usually done eating by 18:00 so i've shortned my fast for tomorrow and i'm annoyed by that as well.

Can i get a rough idea of how you all manage to eat your required calories throughout the day?

Quick average rundown of what i'm trying to eat while trying to get my protein intake high:

Start eating at 12:00 (lunch 450cal)

14:00 (apple + yoghurt 220cal)

17:30 (dinner 550cal)

Finish eating at 18:00 - (banana + protein shake with water 250cal)

It's just not achievable in my opinion. That schedule doesn't even let me fit in an hour of exercise after work (can't workout before work as i can't make noise and wake family up unless i start going to a gym at 4:30am)

I'm not a big eater so i don't think bigger meals and less snacks is an option, plus i won't be eating enough fruit if i do that. I'm either going to try fasting for a shorter time or give it up all together so i can have more time to eat in a realistic time frame and not feel so insanely full all afternoon.

Having recently read ""Fast Like a Girl"", I understand that doing the same thing all the time might not make sense in the context of a menstrual cycle. However, everything I had previously read about forming habits told me that consistency was key - get up at the same time, go to bed at the same time, eat at at the same time, etc. As I understood, this mattered not only in habit formation but also just keeping your body within its circadian rhythm - so it releases cortisol, adrenaline, etc. at the right times to wake you up and melatonin to get you to sleep. And food is a major part of that cycle. So constantly changing up your feeding cycle seems weird. I'm trying to wrap my head around two things that make sense on their own (1. Change your feeding cycle with your menstrual cycle and 2. Maintain a constant feeding cycle for a stable circadian rhythm) but contradict each other. What am I missing or misinterpreting?

283,My first 72 hour fast starts right now!,"I started IF back in March.  I’ve lost over 30 lbs and my BMI is out of the obese range.  Still have at least 24 lbs to go.  But I’m becoming more interested in autophagy benefits.

My plan is next week to do a 96 hour.  I’d like to do at least one 72 hour fast per month and a 96 going into each season.  Will also do one 48 hour fast per week for more time on autophagy.

296,Thoughts after my first week of intermittent fasting.,"Hi all! My first post here and I just want to say thank you to you all. This community has been a great resource while figuring it all out. I also listened to a lot of ""Six Miles To Supper"" who has a refreshing approach. 

Below is my goal, process, and observations of my first week - would love any comments or feedback. 

**Structure**:

My goal is to lose weight. 

My plan is to start fasting after my evening meal (usually between 7-9pm) and fast until 12.00 the next day. This gives an average fast window of 16 hours. 

During my fasting window I drink water and black coffee. When I break the fast, I eat what I want and track my calories. 

I weigh myself first thing in the morning and am tracking a weekly average. 

As yet I have not taken a cheat day but intend to do so when the new routine beds in. 

**Observations**:

The first week has been genuinely surprising. 

The actual fasting has not been the challenge I thought it was going to be. I would not say it has been easy, but easier than expected. Rather than a diet where there is a grey area over if or what I should eat, with fasting you just don’t eat. The simplicity is liberating. 

Sitting with my family as they have breakfast and I have a coffee has not bothered me at all. 

It has been interesting that a lot of the “hungers” I experience when fasting are not from a lack of food. Stress appears to be a big eating trigger for me. Also tiredness. It has definitely made me more aware of what is genuine hunger and what is emotional hunger.

I do tend to get hungry around 10am, but a large glass of water and a coffee tides me over to 12.00.

Keeping physically busy helps get through the hunger rather than sitting around.

The first couple of days I *binged* when I broke my fast to a crazy extent. Well over 1000 calories in my meal. I have rained that in the last couple of days to 5-600 calories. It usually takes my body about 15 mins after I have finished the meal to register it so I keep busy for that time and then I feel great. 

Food tastes way better. 

There is a very pleasant “food high” after the first meal when you break the fast. 

Booze is a tricky one. I am not a big drinker but I noticed on the 2 nights I did have a couple of glasses of wine that I was hungry the next day - I assume that is the sugar content.

Also, my wife pointed out I used to drink a can of diet coke a day. I have not had any all week and this was not deliberate, I just didn’t fancy it. 

Had a couple of nights where I have woken up 5-6 am due to hunger but on the whole slept well. 

According to Fitbit, my resting heart rate has dropped a little and my sleep score has also dropped a little. 

Overall I actually feel great! Far better than when on a typical calorie restricted diet. 

**Conclusion**:

It has brought my relationship with food into sharp relief. It is proof I no longer need to fear hunger, also it has really highlighted that a lot of what I thought was hunger wasn’t! 

This feels good and sustainable. 

I have seen a gentle downward trend of the scales but the real test will be when I compare this weeks average with next weeks average. 

So far so good, looking forwards to week 2!",16ezz34,36,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16ezz34/thoughts_after_my_first_week_of_intermittent/,intermittentfasting

300,IF and crazy life/work schedules,"Not new to fasting but new to IF. I have a crazy life/work schedule where I often work until 11pm. I’m usually hungry then and will eat a small snack (like a few pieces of cheese).

I get up at 6.30am and work in the morning too. And I’m generally a breakfast person. I have been able to push breakfast (a piece of fruit) out to about 10-11am. So according to what I’ve learned so far about IF, that would make my first number a 12.

I have one meal a day, in the late afternoon. After breakfast, I don’t eat again for several hours but does that matter in IF?

Almost 22 lbs down! 59 fasts so far ✅","I’m 23, losing weight seemed impossible; if it wasn’t for this community I don’t know how I’d ever get legitimately started on my weight loss journey. My highest was 302 lbs. Fasting has kept me on top of my snacking and calorie intake. After a month of fasting I added exercise to my routine, I have been going to the gym 3x a week and taking 30 min walks after work 5x a week. Just last week I added some light jogging to my walks and I’m timing my miles to see what progress I’m making :) I’m consuming less than 2143 calories a day and definitely eating better foods. It’s insane how your appetite shrinks! The times I’ve caved and had some secret binging I couldn’t eat the two items I order without getting full after the first one. I sometimes miss my fat girl ways but it was never healthy and nothing beats the feeling of being properly fed and feeling like the T-shirt’s I always wear outside look comically baggy. Just last week I bought two new tops a size smaller than I use to be comfortable buying and they fit so nicely! It feels really good to wear a well fitted shirt and not feel like the worse parts of me are showing. I can’t wait to see see what more this journey will bring.

315,Lower Blood Pressure after a longer (40h) fast?,"39m, 6 months ago my BP was very high.  Like consistently 150+/90+ high.   Also was like 100-ish lbs overweight.   

Started doing daily walks and other exercise.  Started counting cals, eventually decided to pair with IF 16:8.  Down 30+ lbs.    BP got down to high 120's over high 80's in late August with this.    

Had eaten too much in September and really want to hit my weight loss goal this month (almost under 300 lbs) so I decided to try a longer fast (roughly 40 hour, Thurs night to Sat late morning).  

Was worried what this might do to my BP so a few hours after eating today I took it (multiple times) and I was getting 117/78 consistently.   At best I've been within about 10 points of this at any point in my journey.    Wondering if fasting is known to lower BP and if these affects will stick around?

323,Longer fasts as a “reset”?,"Edit: Thank you so much everyone for your thoughts on this. It’s really helping me understand my “why” on doing IF. I think my new plan is to eat when I feel hungry during my normal window today and then start my next fast tonight rather than being overly restrictive. I really appreciate the thoughtfulness of these responses. 


I have done intermittent fasting in the past but this is my first time really buckling down and looking to take it seriously. 

I’ve been consistently following 18:6 for about two weeks now and already noticed a change in my energy and shed a couple pounds! 

Last night was my first night breaking my fast early and going out for drinks and a late night slice of pizza. Good times were had but I’m definitely not going to let this continue through the weekend and looking to hop right back on to my routine. I don’t regret enjoying my night but I also know that I have a tendency to fall off the wagon pretty easily.

My question is, I have this urge to try for a 24 hour fast today as though that would help me get back on track rather than just eating again in my usual window. 

Is there any merit or reason to do a longer fast after an excess caloric night to help “reset” your body back to comfortably fasting? Just curious if anyone has thoughts!",16e9e6n,38,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16e9e6n/longer_fasts_as_a_reset/,intermittentfasting
324,IF and Berberine not working the second time?,"Anyone else had the experience of trying IF and Berberine for several months and it working well for weight loss (around a lb per week), then taking a short break (2-3 months or so, I gained back some weight in this time due to PCOS issues), then resuming again and it not working (ie no weight loss in the same period of time)? 

Because that’s happening to me and I feel very frustrated.

I tried 16:8 before and trying 16:8 again now, only drink unsweetened iced tea in the fast. Not lost any weight in the past month, even though I consistently lost weight the first time every week. I eat very well during my eating window and don’t over-consume calories. I’m eating the same way I did when I lost weight the first time. 

I always gain weight around my period and ovulation so I weigh myself regularly and I’m comparing apples to apples times of the month so I know there’s no factor there.

I have PCOS, hence the Berberine (insulin issues).",16e8ycp,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16e8ycp/if_and_berberine_not_working_the_second_time/,intermittentfasting

349,My Glucose Monitor Experiment,"I have a new toy: a Contour Next Blood Glucose Monitor. I'm not diabetic but since I've been back on low carb/keto and serious intermittent fasting, I really want to understand how my body responds to what I eat. I've only had it since yesterday but I've tested numerous times... again, just because I 'm curious about my blood glucose. 

Here is the most interesting thing I've found so far: my glucose was 84 before bulletproof coffee (I consumed nothing other than black coffee that day). Thirty minutes after BPC (which I hated, by the way), my glucose was 72. That's pretty amazing. BPC actually made my glucose go down! Just so you know, a healthy fasting glucose is between 70 and 100, so I'm well within a good range.

For lunch, I had baked ham (attached fat and all!), Italian sausage, and sautéed onions. My glucose before was 74 and 30 minutes after it was 76... again how is this possible? I dunno but I am enjoying this new information.

I have a few other tests I will do, like how apple cider vinegar impacts glucose. I've read that if you drink ACV 30 minutes before you eat a carb-heavy  meal, your blood sugar won't spike quite as high. I'm not going to rush into this one, because I'm still afraid of carbs, but this is on my list.

Just thought I'd share... In case you are wondering, the cost was less than $20 for the monitor and less than $20 for 35 testing strips. Oh yeah, and it has an app so it logs my readings automatically via Bluetooth and is compatible with Apple Health.

365,IF and tattoo healing : an experiment,"Hi,
Im about to embark on an experiment and thought you would enjoy reading about it. Ideas are welcome if you think something can be easily improved.

TLDR : im gonna try and see if IF can help my new tattoo heal faster than the previous one, as a mice experiment suggested.

TW : I will be discussing skin wounds and skin healing.


Context :
I read this study ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25881054/ )
where mice were made to fast, then got a skin wound (sorry mice), and then fasting mice were compared to the control ones and voila, wounds healed faster.
As I was about to get a new tat, I wanted to test it out on myself.
The mice fasting protocol was 4 days every two weeks, for two months. There was no way I was doing that so I went with my usual 17/7, but on the week leading to the tattoo (current week), I've added two 20h+ fasts (21 and 24 respectively). I've been doing IF for 4 months.

My control : im usually a fast healer when it comes to skin. My previous tattoo lost its last scabs and had its definitive appearance after 10 to 11 days.


Limits : 
Loads! My control is a past event, the time of year and temperatures are very different (last time it was december), my protocol is actually not similar to that of the mice experiment, a tattoo isnt the same as a biopsy punch wound, and most of all, im the only subject. 
To be clear, im aware this isnt scientific at all, and no matter the results, it wont be meaningful as anything else than an anecdote.

Tattoo is tomorrow (saturday) at noon (GMT+2). Ill come back and edit the post with results/observations as I get them. Feel free to ask questions and/or suggest stuff!


Edit 1 :
So im now at H+9.
On the whole I've felt better than last time, I wasnt knackered when I left, even though the session was longer, and the skin is less sensitive to touch right now.

Edit 2 :
Roughly H+34
First night and day were easy, it's a bit tender under the warm water when i shower but beside that it's all good. Last time was way sorer (is that a word?) during the first day.
Ive put on healing lotion for the first time tonight. I had zero ink bleed last night, ill see if the lotion opens the gates (it usually does, but not a ton either, scabs are usually where i lose the most ink).

Edit 3 : 
H+45
The bright black look is fading so healing is happening ! Still no ink bleed. Soreness is unchanged. I have to wear real clothes again and I cycled to work morning. No major pain but i certainly feel my chinos on the thigh tat.
The scabing is minimal so far and im a bit perplexed about that. I usually scab BIG and then it goes away fast with minimal scaring. Im nearing the 48h mark and still no big one. Nothing is red or puffy so i dont think it's a bad sign but still.

Edit 4:
Three days (minus a few hours) in.
Still no ink bleed or big scab. Minimal scabbing is going on. I honestly dont know if that is better, worse, or just different than my usual healing pattern. 
Last time it took three days for the itchiness to start, so if im operating on the same schedule it means today is the day. 
Lines are still raised (mostly on the hip, the thigh zone is much smoother) and soreness when touched is still at the same level. Even whith 12h+ between skin lotion applications, skin doesnt feel dry or tight.

Edit 5 : roughly 15h after edit 4
Itching DID start today, oh boy, also all soreness disappeared during the day. Scabing is definitely happening to the naked eye, even though those scabs are quite pliable and soft.

Edit 6 : 4 days and a few hours
Itching is awful. One of the pieces has started some dead skin shedding in the shower. The whole thing currently looks awful so healing is going along as expected. So far I would say my healing schedule is similar if not identical to last time.

Edit 7 : 5 day and a few hours
SO MUCH dead skin, either flaking away or about to. So much. I wont ever have skin ever again.

Edit 8 : same day after a shower
Okay one of the main zones (hip) is nearly all peeled off, it's the one I mentioned has started peeling on day 4. Colour is much better and oh the blessed non-itchiness. The other main zone (thigh) is, id say, 40% done. Weirdly enough, it's the smallest zone, the little touch up the artist did on my previous tattoo (other hip) that not only is flaking off yet or even has itched much so far. 
Anyways im really relieved im nearly done with the worst part.

Edit 9 : 10 days and a few hours in
Nearly all (if not really all) the flaking off/peeling off is done. Colour is consistant with previous tattoos, skin doesn't it nor feel sore anymore, all seems well. That being said, the bigger lines are still shiny and slightly raised, suggesting all healing isn't actually done. This is quite different from previous tattoo, that was entirely settled by day 9-10.

374,"If you have a period, the scale is a liar","I just wanted to send out a little encouragement to those that experience periods, and are on a weightloss journey. When I first started someone posted something similar on Reddit and I found it soooo encouraging. I’ve been doing 16:8 with CICO. 


From the 22nd August to 2nd September (11 days) I had steady decreases, or at least the scale was moving down on average.


However as soon as I hit the 3rd of September my weight spiked up 500g (1.12 pounds) and did not drop until the 6th of September where I suddenly “lost” 850g in one night (1.874 pounds). Now it’s physically impossible to lose that much overnight except through release of water retention and bloating.


While that might not seem a huge number of days to wait, in reality it is enough to feel like derailing because you can’t see the progress. It is also not uncommon for me to not see any weight loss for the entire period from ovulation to menstruation and then suddenly drop a kilo overnight from bloating.


So all this to say, keep on pushing through, be encouraged, see out the month to determine true progress and perhaps consider tracking your cycle phases to see any patterns that may occur.",16crdsc,109,29,https://i.redd.it/ws0ved0okwmb1.jpg,intermittentfasting

IF anywhere from 16-20 hrs with a MORNING eating window which I truly believe was the game changer for me. I have done IF in the past with a later window and never had this much consistent success. I finish eating for the day around noon to 2 pm depending on when I start and when I get my calories in. I eat around 1500 a day give or take, I try to fluctuate it (that has adjusted here and there when I was in more of a deficit and weighed more obviously), very little exercise aside from being a mom to my 6 kids, and the occasional home light weights, yoga, walking etc. I eat lower carb but NOT keto, I will have real bread and potatoes and sugar all the carby stuff as long as I can fit it into my lower carb macros (about 80 net now). My baby is 9.5 months old now, I am breastfeeding and my milk supply has never been better! I have started to dirty fast this last month of maintenance, but I have noticed I have been more hungry at night when I hadn’t been for months. Thinking of either upping my daytime calories and dirty fasting and seeing what happens, or going back to a clean fast.

420,What makes you fall off the wagon?,"I recently did, after three months of fasting and IF. I’m back now for the third day in a row. I thought it could be interesting to reflect on what makes us fall off the wagon when we do.. and how it unfolds and how we get back to it.

For me, it was just an extra stressful day with the kids.. nothing major. That was it. So I got stressed and I started stress-eating. One day.

But there is something addictive about using food in an emotional way. It’s not necessarily the food itself bc during IF, I was able to have whatever as a meal and it didn’t make me crave more. I was in a different place in my consciousness. 

But the idea that energy comes from food.. that seems to have been what caused it for me. 

So that was all that was needed to make me fall off the wagon for a week. I immediately felt worse in my body again, fatigue, low energy, aches, stress.

I calmed down my system, the way I go through my day, enough to finally get back on three days ago. I’m starting to feel a bit better again. I feel that I need to manage my stress levels. Outside of a proper retreat, when life continues around you as usual, it can be challenging at times.

425,IF + Macros,"Hi All,

I’ve been doing 16:8 IF since July 2023. The first month my weight dropped about 7lbs pretty fast. However, afterwards, it fluctuated from 8-10lbs loss. I joined IF because I was completely against counting calories as I felt it wasn’t sustainable.

I figured that my weight was fluctuating due to my monthly cycle but it didn’t quite drop back to where it was days after it ended and so this made me feel like I was doing something wrong. 

Aside from doing IF, I exercise 5-6 times per week (4 days strength/weightlifting & 2-3 days cycling). I was also eating very healthy and focused more on protein, healthy fats, and low carb. My sugar intake was very minimal as well (I.e. my coffee creamer, fruit, and occasional gum). 

Albeit, after not seeing my weight loss progress the way I was hoping I figured that I was probably overeating - regardless of how much I thought I wasn’t. So I bit the bullet and started using MyFitnessPal app again. I decided to go the route of counting macros so I purchased their premium version.

Tracking my eating revealed that I was actually under eating. At the end of each day I usually have 500+ calories available to use. And although this would be great for mere CICO, I’ve been trying to meet my Macro requirements but it’s been a real struggle. 

I actually have no problem hitting my protein goal. But in the last hour of my eating window I struggle  to find food items that fulfill the fat and (mostly) carb requirements. I’ve even stretched my window out a whole hour beyond my desired fasting start time to try and fit more food in my stomach. This literally makes me feel very stuffed and uncomfortable.

So I guess my question is, how important is it to hit every Macro? I’ve been deficient in my carb intake by nearly 100grams on a few days. However, I’m usually w/in a good range on protein and fat (because I can always use MCT oil to supplement this requirement).

What seems to be missing in the bigger picture is: *Why can't it be a practical simple kind-hearted approach in tiny steps?* such as start with 12/12 (then celebrate!), then 14/10 (then celebrate!), then 16/8.  Instead, what is communicated is if you don’t do 16/8 first (with ONLY black coffee), you can’t lose weight. Why stress over cream in coffee in the beginning? Isn’t it better to have fasted 12 hours and drank coffee/cream, than having done nothing at all? Some language in IF encouages people to obssess over tiny things - And emphasize following celebrity authors, some with questionable science. It feels like a repeat of diet culture. It shouldn’t have to be this complicated.  Forgive - I know I sound harsh, that is not my intention.

My SW: 220lbs, CW: 190lbs. GW: 175lbs. height 5-10

1. My A1C was 6.4 which is in borderline diabetic range.
2. My liver tests: AST and ALT was off the charts with severe case of fatty liver disease, so much so that my doctor recommended me to do liver scan to check for scar tissues and liver damage.
3. My cholesterol, particularly triglyceride was off the charts with very low HDL and high LDL.
4. Had frequent gout attacks due to high uric acid.
5. mild hypertension with BP 90-130 range.

So I was on path to start diabetes, blood pressure, liver and cholesterol medicine and doctor already prescribed me those.  But later somehow I stumbled upon and this sub and knew a friend who got miraculous results from IF which motivated me to start on this journey.

Now, to me its nothing sort of miraculous cure all, mother of all medicine!!  My test results, BP are all normal, no more gout attacks. I read somewhere autophagy helps with cancer prevention as well but not sure without 24hr+ fast I can trigger autophagy or not.

 On a plus side I save on groceries, snacks etc and not  constantly worrying about what to eat next! 

Seriously, I cannot fathom why entire nation not doing this or why doctors are not actively prescribing this.

454,Back on the IF wagon after the holiday weekend,"Male 53 | SW 204 | CW 196 | GW 185. It's been about six weeks of intermittent fasting 16/8 (8pm-12pm). I typically give myself one weekend cheat day where I have breakfast with the kids around 8 am. I also have a beer or bourbon with dinner, but I still start my fasting window at 8pm. This past Labor Day weekend, I allowed myself to have breakfast Fri/Sat/Sun/Mon, as well as dinner past 8 pm, except for Monday night when I started my fasting window at 8pm, as usual. I also did two Orange Theory morning workouts on an empty stomach over the weekend, so that helped. 

I weighed myself this morning, and I thought I would've gained a couple of pounds. I was actually the same. Now, I'm back on IF for the week, and we'll see how things go. Anyone else like me where you're not super-strict but you fast most of the week and then do a cheat day + semi-indulgence over holidays/vacations? How's it going for you?

473,Will This Work?,"Hello! I'm kind of new to IF, but I've heard a lot of good things about it and I'm trying to get into it. I struggle with my weight, and traditional diets are hard for me because I'm a big foodie--I love ""soul food"" and don't like the idea of eating salads all the time.

Right now, I've jumped into doing the 36:12 fast, where I basically eat normally one day and then nothing the next. The only issue is my coffee addiction. I need caffeine every day, but I hate black coffee with a passion. I have a latte machine at home, and always make myself an Almond Milk latte in the morning. Overall, it's about 200 calories or so, no more than 300 if I make it really big. The Almond Milk is super low cal, and the only thing that adds any calories at all is flavoring syrup. Now, this added sugar does make me hungrier, but I've been able to resist temptation anyway. So it really has worked in that regard, and on my fast days, I look forward to that one cup of coffee in the morning.

Is it okay if I have lattes during the fast days, as long as that is the ONLY calories I consume during the day? I know I won't lose weight as quickly as if I didn't, but I'm okay with that. I just want to know whether I will still lose weight by eating normally one day and then severely restricting calories to 200 every other day.

SOME INFORMATION: I was heartbroken. This time last year I was 167 and I was successful in my Noom experience. I got a new job, one that was an office gig, more pay and stuff. The cost? I wasn’t as physical, and I was unable to purchase the same dietary items I was using. So I gained all the weight back and then some. 


I’ve already started 23:1 by simply just eating once a day. My goal is/was regardless of what I ate, just once. I’ve since gotten to the point where when I do eat more than once a day it’s usually because I’m so stressed that I cave. I’ve held to once a day for over two months now. 


With that said, I just wanted to verify some information.


I was told that I can’t drink anything but water or anything with sugar. Is this true? I’ve been careful to drink mostly tea, sometimes I go about unsweet, or low sugar, and I do drink sweetened teas throughout the day along with water. Am I suppose to stop drinking sugar completely?


I’ve gotten to the point of eating once a day, and to be clear I have been controlling my portions throughout this some days are easier than others, but going forward what would be a good caloric cap? Or do I even need one? Do I simply eat until I satisfied?


Are their certain foods outside of sugar(my other question will basically cover sugar) I should avoid?

So I've been on this diet for a little over a month now (started Aug 01), and I can't help but notice I only take a poop like once every 3-4 days now... and when I do poop it doesn't seem like a lot of poop comes out? 🤨

Before when I was eating ""normally"" or the standard American 3 meals a day I remember I was pretty regular in the bathroom. Pooping every day or every other day - and plenty of decently sized turds would come out

Suddenly ever since doing a mix of OMAD and 20:4 seems like all the poop ""mysteriously disappeared"" lol

Anyways, I assume this is just a standard side-effect of this IF diet, since less food going in = less ""material"" to make poop out of, but I figured I would run this by you guys so maybe we can compare & contrast notes

506,For my PCOS/Thyroid sisterd - 16lb in a month,"I (29F 217SW) have autoimmune thyroid disease for years and end of July, I was 'lucky' enough to be diagnosed with PCOS.

Losing weight has always been really tough for me and finally this year I found out why - being insulin resistant together with my very abnormal BMR (much lower metabolism than normal people)

From August 6th, I took out all my courage and started IF again, only this time, with the diet macro and supplements adviced for PCOS patients.

It has been incredibly hard but I managed to lose weight despite the difficulty. Within a month I have lost 16lbs and it gave me a lot of hope.

I wish a lot of people, especially ladies who have similar conditions, can keep going and thrive with your medical conditions that fucks up your weight and confidence.. I will keep trying with y'all.",169frd4,213,18,https://i.redd.it/fklsm7svh5mb1.png,intermittentfasting

Is this how 16:8 is usually done, two meals? 

Do I need to strictly focus on and control my calories consumed, considering I’ll be cutting out completely all the junk food I’d normally eat anyway? 

Does the 16:8 time actually matter or can I just do two meals a day?

Should I also work to reduce the amount of food I eat at lunch and dinner?

Does the hunger go away after some time doing 16:8?

508,IF and PMS/weight gain/bloating?,"I’m only a week into IF.

That being said, I’ve gained over 5 pounds this past week and am super bloated! I have a mirena so I never really know where I’m at in my cycle but I think I just ovulated, so I’d be bloating now anyways, but this is FAR more intense than before IF.

510,Days Off?,"Hey all! I'm looking to do IF starting Tuesday 9/5 (just coming off a week of vacation and indulgence).   
I'm F/36/5'5"" CW 165lbs / GW 130lbs / BMI 32. Just wondering in general what everyone's ""schedule"" might look like? Do you take certain days off, weekends, do IF every single day? Also, do you all plan your workouts on certain days, or times of day? I know everyone's journey is different, but just curious how you all plan out your weeks/days?

 A little background on me: I've been trying CICO and workouts for over a year now and lost only 5 lbs, so I need something else! I work from home M-F and like to have a beer(White Claw) usually on Friday night, or Saturday. I know a bit about fat burning as I did full Keto for a full year back in 2016 and lost 35lbs, So I know alcohol is not a good idea as it's the first thing our body will try to burn before carbs and fat(Do I do myself a huge favor and just cut it out 100%? I'm thinking yes lol). Not looking to do Keto this time, but have been reading up on IF and it sounds like the fat loss process in our bodies is similar with autophagy and a certain state of ""ketosis"" to help with that ""switch"" to fat burning mode at 16 hours fasted. My fiancé and I do our grocery shopping on Thursdays and usually will order take out that night for dinner while we are in town, but otherwise cook our own meals every other night. Meals typically include a protein, veggie and a carb so, pretty well balanced. I am rarely hungry in the morning, so a 16/8 or even 18/6 would be perfect for me to just have lunch and dinner. I know to also still stick to a calorie deficit still. I do love my coffee in the morning, but I also love my creamers, so I will need to experiment with going back to maybe a bulletproof variation or find some non insulin spiking sweetener(any suggestions there?). 

I also have Ulcerative Colitis and have been in a pretty bad flair for about a month (work stress and just terrible food choices) and I know that slowing and reducing my food input will help my symptoms a ton. My fiancé and I are also going to be starting a family in the next year or so, so I'd like to get to my goal weight/healthier overall before becoming pregnant so I can have a healthy pregnancy(lower blood pressure, lower risk of complications etc.) Curious what time frames people have in terms of how long it took you to lose about 30lbs? (Don't come for me! Again; I know each person is very different but just a general idea in months is helpful to me to know if it's ""working"" or not and what I that I need to change something to fix it. I also know that measurements, clothes that don't fit, are a better indicator than scale weight, so I will be tracking that as well).  

Thank you all! Feel free to DM me if you have any other personal stories you think could be helpful! 

TLDR : What is your weekly schedule for IF and also workouts?(Every day, other day, certain days/times of day etc) Coffee sweetener recommendations(not black)?  Cut out alcohol 100%? General time frame of losing 30lbs in months doing IF? ",169d5b2,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/169d5b2/days_off/,intermittentfasting

Though I make sure I keep the carb intake low (I’ve been doing this for awhile) and total intake under 1500kcal/day. I fill my meals with lots of vegetables, avoid any junk food, and restrict fried/heavily seasoned food. I don’t binge eat and drink plenty of water.

The thing is that my progress has been so slow compared to a lot of people I see here, even though they don’t workout or do any intense dieting. I lost about 5lbs at this point, and with me already being overweight, this is barely a progress. I want to say it’s just a number, but that number goes up by 1-2lb just by slightly higher calorie intake in a day, but takes a week or longer to bring it down. It frustrates me just too much sometimes how slow the progress is.

517,Suddenly hungry/clean fast,"Background: I’ll be 9 months post-partum on Weds. Started IF in May, easing in, and have averaged 20/4 or OMAD since July. I’ve been on Team NoScale, but have been taking measurements which have reflected at change of at least 15 inches all over—likely more as I didn’t start measuring until mid-June. My fasts prior to 3 days ago were not clean, I was having cream and a pinch of sugar in my large iced coffee. 

Last week I noticed that for the first time there’d been zero change in measurements. This happened to coincide with reading *Feast. Fast. Repeat*. I should also add that I’ve previously read *The Obesity Code* and as a bioscience-oriented person, the science made a ton of sense, and validated my own anecdotal experiences. The two books taken together are an interesting juxtaposition in terms of attitudes towards “dirty” vs. “clean” fasting, and in general I tend towards a “whatever works for you” mindset. I think I’ve secretly expected that eventually I’d have to go clean to keep shaving off the baby weight, and after no change in measurements at last measure, I believe that time has likely come. I plan to weigh after completing 28 days of clean fasting.

The issue/question: Today is day 4 of clean fasting and for the first time since basically starting IF, I feel incredibly hungry almost right away in the mornings. On Friday the hunger was so persistent even after two big black coffees that I broke fast at 17 hours where 20 has been my minimum for 2 months! Is this really all because of cutting out a little cream and a pinch of sugar, or might something else be going on? I have been eating a good amount of dried mango at night recently, but that’s not wholly unusual where early hunger definitely is. I was feeling really excited for potential changes that may come from clean fasting but so far the only change has been a significant increase in hunger signaling. Has anyone else experienced anything similar and if so, how long did it last? Suggestions on how to get through this adjustment period?

IF has enabled me to almost get back to my college weight, and it’s been relatively easy (after the first week of adjusting). But there’s a big draw back.

Today I went for a swim, and I haven’t been since I started IF. Was wearing my usual swim shorts, nothing to worry about.

My problem is with the first few hours of a fast. My family and I have dinner together, it’s often the time I break my fast. It’s important that we have that time together as we don’t get a chance to eat together as a family at any other time. 

My problem is with the first few hours after that meal. I snack! Even if I set myself up as fasting using my tracking apps. I even write the time I’ve started fasting on my hand with sharpie to remind myself not to eat anymore. But so often I cheat, eat something high carb or sweet and that can often become a bit of a binge. 

This is regardless of how big my main meal is, whether or not there’s carbs, or how much protein. I always have a huge amount of vegetables. 

Once I’ve established the fast though (say by mid evening onwards), fasting is incredibly easy to stick to. So I’m confused, and would really love any advice.

533,Never thought I could survive without coffee & creamer!,"I started IF two weeks ago. I started on this journey b/c I’m a mom of two young boys and about 30 pounds overweight (5’2”)… and I have been struggling to stay energetic and engaged in the way I want to and need to for my boys. I’m hoping this lifestyle will help me get control of my extra weight (most of its in the lower belly), help my digestive pain and intense bloating, as well as to help my energy levels. I’m also hypothyroid so that doesn’t help my lack of energy either!

As I mentioned I am only two weeks in, but one of the best changes I have noticed so far… is how much easier mornings have been for me. I have been waking up with much less struggle - and lately even waking up before my boys do (which otherwise would have been unheard of for me). It used to take me about 45 mins just to get out of bed in the morning (constantly hitting snooze). 

Most of all, I never thought I could survive a day without my coffee and creamer. I would rely on it to function and look forward to it every morning; otherwise I would feel like a zombie! But since I break my fast at 11am now I have been finding I don’t crave coffee at that point anymore, and can continue the day with enough energy to not need it at all. That in and of itself is a miracle for me. 

I am currently doing 16:8. I’m hesitant to do intervals much longer than that because I want to keep this up and make sure it’s sustainable. I have had disorder eating in the past and I don’t want to get into extremes.

537,Feels like I'm eating too much even when I'm under a thousand calories?,"Just as the titled suggested, I'm doing OMAD with an eating window of an hour. Today, I mixed three eggs with a splash of milk, paired it with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, two pieces of bacon (45 calories each) a handful of onions and two handfuls of peppers and topped it with two slices of low fat cheese. 

I then put about 6 spoonfuls on my plate alongside some pancakes pieces (which all together came to about 700 calories.)

I ate, and immediately felt like I was full, way too full, even though I had barely touched my plate. 

I know I'm not eating too much because I've steadily been losing weight, and I know you're not supposed to eat under 1200 calories (I checked my TDEE and it said 1300 calories a day was enough for me to lose weight) but I can't help but feel like I'm eating way too much. 

Even the scrambled eggs, which I got off of keto, felt too much. I feel not only too full, but guilty as well, because it honestly feels like even during my window period, I'm using it as an excuse to overeat.

541,"""I must not snack"" (with apologies to Frank Herbert/Dune):","“I must not snack. 

Snacking is the diet-killer. 

Snacking is the little-meal that brings weight-gain. 

I will face my hunger. 

I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 

And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Where the hunger has gone there will be nothing. 

Only I will remain.”

Trying to put a light-hearted spin on some of my personal IF experience; I'm sure this advice is not news to many of you.

I've been maintaining +/- 3 lbs. on 16:8 for the past couple of months, and far and away I find I do much, much better if I eat large, filling meals a couple of times a day and avoid snacking.

If I can eat to satiation, I find my calorie count by the end of the day is so much lower than if I try to graze periodically and never actually satisfy my hunger.

If I *do* get hungry between meals - keeping a big bottle of zero-calorie  flavoured electrolyte water kills the cravings 9 times out of 10.

That's all - just a little unsolicited anecdote from someone who has benefited greatly from this subreddit.

547,"Hello, noob here just making sure i'm doing things right.","I'm 35, male, 170cm (5'7) 86kg (190lbs)
New to reddit and new to fasting, currently doing 18/6 on a 1200 calorie diet with a goal to lose weight. 

About 6 years ago i dropped from 90kg to 70kg by doing 9km on the treadmill every day and eating cleaner. I hated the treadmill and was still very unhappy with my body, so i guess my goal would be under 65kg.

I work in an office and basically do no exercise at all at the moment. I know that would help me lose weight but i've tried workout routines multiple times in the past and always end up despising it or injuring myself and just giving up.. so i thought i'd try something new focusing on calorie intake.

I just started last Monday eating from 12pm to 8pm, but this week i've extended it by 2 hours and finish eating at 6pm.

I'm also only consuming 1200 calories (as close to as i can)

Around 400cal for lunch, 100cal greek yoghurt, 600cal for dinner and a banana just before 6pm.

Drinking at least 4L of water as well (all day and night)

One week into it and I weighed 3.5kg less this Monday, so off to a good start i guess. Planning to weigh myself each Monday when i wake up.

Much easier than i expected with no negative side effects as of yet.

So i have a few questions.

* is there much more benefit doing 18/6 compared to 16/8?
* black coffee with stevia isn't going to break my fast?

Thanks for your time, any tips welcome. I'll update my weight every monday and anything else worth noting.",16843bl,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16843bl/hello_noob_here_just_making_sure_im_doing_things/,intermittentfasting

She then says that Day 1 to Day 10 of your period is the ‘Power phase’ which is when you will naturally feel like doing longer fasts. However I find that I am the opposite and that coming up to my period I can fast easily for longer periods with no cravings but then from Day 1 when I get my period I tend to do shorter fasts naturally and crave carbs and chocolate like crazy.

Now I'm giving it another go, but doing 5:2 (the Fast 800 Diet) and so far I'm not doing too bad! I'm learning to ignore the hunger on the lower-calorie days as well as trying to get the most bang for my buck when it comes to food choices on those days because I have to prioritize protein and fiber while minimizing calories. I've found a couple solid meal choices that keep me full for a decent chunk of the day, and when the weather gets cooler, I know I'll be drinking more hot tea too and that will help me feel full for a bit.

Thankfully my appetite seems to be adjusting slowly, either that or I'm just getting better at ignoring my stomach. I also notice I seem to not get as hungry on days when I eat more (I aim for 1400-1500 calories a day those other five days of the week), so I can eat less on my non-fasting days too.

I'm about seven pounds lighter than I was at this time last week, which I know is most likely water weight. But hey I'll take what I can get! It's not as easy as CICO, but it's doable.

Hi all so glad I found this community! I’ve been on IF for 17 days and down 8 lbs already! Doing 18:6 and staying around or less than 50g carbs a day. Making better food choices when I do eat. But other than that I haven’t changed anything in my day to day. After the 1 month mark I’m going to add in exercising. 

I have a 4 year old and a 15 month old and I realized I can’t run in the park with them to fly a kite. I can barely walk up 1 flight of stairs without getting winded to the point it’s hard to talk to someone. I want to be there to see them get married and walk them down the aisle and see grand kids. So I decided now is the time to get me to a healthy place. Ketosis has been almost like magic weight loss. 

I do have a question when I start exercising should I do mostly weights or cardio? My biggest goals are 1. Lose 50lbs(233>180) and 2. Increase stamina/lung capacity.

603,Would continuously raised insulin cause weight gain even if calories in don't exceed TDEE?,"So insulin is a fat storage hormone, right?

Does this mean that continuous ng tube feeding cause weight gain even if calories don't exceed TDEE?

I am talking about continuous ng feeding where a patient is fed a certain number of ml per hour for 20 hours with a 4 hour break at night.

Insulin is released every time we eat. Insulin causes the body to store glucose as fat and inhibits the body from burning fat stores. If you are being fed continuously by an ng tube, you are effectively continuously eating. So your body will be continually producing insulin. So it will just be storing fat.

E.g. a person might be fed 100 calories of ng feed per hour for 20 hours straight for 2000 calories in total. If their TDEE was 2000 calories a day, would this make them gain weight?

Their calories in wouldn't exceed their calories out, which would suggest that they wouldn't gain weight. But their body would be continuously producing insulin which promotes fat storage and this suggests that they would gain weight.

I ask because I'm currently in hospital on a continuous ng feed.",166f233,21,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/166f233/would_continuously_raised_insulin_cause_weight/,intermittentfasting

I’ve been intermittent fasting for the past eight days and it’s surprisingly been going okay (black coffee and chicken broth have been incredibly helpful!). I have to lose about 50 lbs and I’m scared that I’ll relapse back into binge-eating. When I discuss this diet or my weight loss goal with my mom or grandma, they start complaining about my new lifestyle. They keep insisting that I should eat throughout the day instead. The problem though, is that eating schedule doesn’t work for me. They’ve never had to lose a copious amount of weight and they’ve never struggled with over-eating like I have. I reached out to my mom today because I was feeling scared that I would eventually give up this new lifestyle and not be able to lose 50 lbs. Instead of supporting me, she told me that I should go on a low-carb diet and go on the South Beach diet. It’s just frustrating because everyone has complained about my weight gain, but now that I’m losing weight these people are still unhappy.

Edit: I just wanted to add that when my family members complain about my weight gain or my choice to intermittent fast, it makes me really sad which then makes me want to binge-eat.

607,Golden paste - tumeric w IF,"Hello,
D
New to IF. Been reading a bunch of info and trying to determine what to do. 

About 2 months ago I started taking golden paste (tumeric, coconut oil, black pepper) a few times a day for joint inflammation and pain. About 1/4 tsp each time. It's worked wonders and I don't want to stop.

This week, I started IF. Easing in with a small fast (15:9 to start bc that works w my work/home schedule and once I'm in a routine I will go longer).

My question is: how much will 1 dose of golden paste mess up my fast. I usually take it in the morning with water?
I know we aren't supposed to do anything with calories but it would be hard for me to skip this one.
The hope is that w IF my inflammation decreases and I not longer need the golden paste! 

For reference, a batch of GP includes 1-1.5 cups of water, 1/2 c turmeric 1/3 cup coconut oil. 
I take 1/4 teaspoon 3x a day.

612,Specific food and snack cravings. I’m struggling right now. I want that cookie.,"I’m 3 weeks in and I think I’ve already lost 2kg since starting 16:8 (SW73kg 5”3 F) and cutting out snacks completely but omg… the cravings are so hard to beat. 

I use to snack ALL THE TIME. It’s ridiculous how much I ate. I think this was due to working from home, being comfortable, and having no self control. I’m mentally fine but I just got too comfortable with that lifestyle and only realised how unhealthy it was when my doctor weighed me and told me I was overweight. And since that dreaded appointment, I’ve been so motivated to lose weight and be at a more healthier weight. 

First two weeks of IF were a breeze. I never use to exercise so now I’m committed to getting more steps in daily. Did some longer walks the second week, I was already feeling so much better. In my mind, my body… just felt super happy and fit.

Then this week being my third. I could feel my old self creeping back and wanting more more more. I’ve had specific cravings like chocolate chip cookies that I use to heat up in the oven and snack on as a dessert with hot tea at night. I know I don’t want to go back to that but sometimes like now, I think to myself “just this once” but then the once turns to the second night and then eventually I’ll be back to square one. 

Luckily I have a really supportive partner who isn’t doing IF but encourages me to eat better and will walk with me when he feels like it. He didn’t guilt me about the cookie craving but he put into perspective of what my day will look like tomorrow. He said “if you eat this cookie now, you’ll break your fast and you’ll complain about not being able to sleep” And I responded “well I can try a one day meal tomorrow!” He then replied honestly and earnestly “No. No you won’t and I know you’ll want a second meal and I can’t force you to not eat so we will end up eating more” … I huffed and puffed knowing how right he was and I hated how well he knew me haha. A few minutes passed and now I’m having a hot bath, no longer hungry and just relaxing until bed time.

Since starting a mix 18/6 IF (4xweek) + 36h long fasting (1xweek) I've noticed a huge improvement in libido and constant erections especially towards the end of the 36h fasting.

I'm trying to figure out possible reasons behind this so I can think how can I respond to my problems when in non-fasted states.

1- HGH gets boosted by up to 500% around the 48h fasting mark > It would lead to a LH rise? (my LH lab values are always borderline low)

623,!August Abs Check! + IF habits/lifestyle update,"(my pronouns are ze/zir/zirs, he/him/his, they/them/their)

Hello again, everyone! It's been some time since my last post.

Because of the heatwave in AZ rn [every time I visit family down here there's a heat wave! (⁠┛⁠✧⁠Д⁠✧⁠)⁠)⁠┛⁠彡⁠┻⁠━⁠┻ ], it's been too hot for me to complete my usual work-outs; I've been sedentary this month. I've gotten in a few workouts (maybe 1-2 intense/moderate sessions a week), and I've stuck to short morning yoga sessions, but that's about it.

I more-or-less have kept to my IF routines. I've been lax with my eating windows, but my fasting times remain consistent. I also completed a 24+hr fast on Monday w/o noticing, because I was burned out from preparing my language lesson plans and meeting some development deadlines. So, I just stayed in bed. (My AuDHD burn-outs are more brutal during the summer, I swear! 🙃)

I was also more lax with my diet. Cookies, pastries, ice cream, and pasta were getting some love from me this month (⁠ꏿ⁠﹏⁠ꏿ⁠;⁠)

Because this lack of activity and devil-may-care attitude towards my diet in August, I didn't think I made any progress. I honestly thought that I had back tracked. But today I took some selfies just to test my suspicions, and well... I'm pleasantly surpised that my abs are still showing! It was a confidence booster.

After 3 months, IF is back to being a habit that I don't much have to think about, so even when I'm not actively doing it I more or less stick to OMAD or two smaller meals + a snack (like cereal a couple hours before bed). Occasionally I'll go 1-3 days with 14hr or shorter fasting windows, but I always switch back within the week. I also now unconsciously stick with my fasting windows, and I no longer make a grab for a bunch of snacks when I'm stressed. 

I know my abs are the subject of today's post, but I've also noticed the definition in my shoulders, biceps, and pecs returning. I still have a relatively high body fat percentage for my taste (around 20-22%), but my BMI and weight are now back in the higher end of the ""normal"" range for my height, age and assigned sex, at least by western standards. My weight's new daily average is 70–72kg, as opposed to when I restarted IF in June when I averaged 76-78kg, with an estimated body fat percentage of 28-29%.

I felt a bit down this month because I haven't been as active as I would like, and thus felt behind in my progress. But, looking at these photos reminds me that I'm doing just fine! 

I'm looking forward to see what my progress will be at the end of 2023! ᕙ⁠(⁠＠⁠°⁠▽⁠°⁠＠⁠)⁠ᕗ",165q9pd,24,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/165q9pd,intermittentfasting

635,UPDATE - Mayo Clinic IF study is complete (for me)," UPDATE 

Original post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/141el3o/mayo\_clinic\_if\_study/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/141el3o/mayo_clinic_if_study/)

To recap, Mayo Clinic is conducting a study that compares IF results based on time of day. Volunteers were blindly put into one of two groups:

Group A can only eat between 8 AM and 4 PM 

Group B can only eat between noon and 8 PM.

Zero calorie drinks are the only thing allowed outside of those windows. During the study, we were not to introduce any other changes, like diet and / or exercise. Only the IF process was to be introduced. 

I was randomly assigned to Group B

The 12-week study has concluded (for me) and here are the results:

Number of times that I ate outside of the window during the 12-week study - 4

Starting weight – 218lbs

Starting waist – 112 cm

Starting BMI – 27.9

Starting A1C – 5.4

&#x200B;

Ending weight – 212lbs (6 LB loss)

Ending waist – 104 cm (8 cm loss)

Ending BMI – 27.2 (.7 loss)

Ending A1C – 5.4 (unchanged)

&#x200B;

When the entire study is complete, I will receive a letter in the mail sharing the study-level results. I will share that with all of you too unless it is forbidden. I'm expecting it to be public. 

There may be an interest in doing further studies that also introduce diet / exercise with IF. I’ll participate if so. 

Moving to IF was not a hardship for me. In fact, I was surprised that I had any positive results at all.  Unlike other weight loss methods, I can still eat the things that I enjoy, I just have to be a little patient. So... I’m a convert! I plan to stick with IF but will alter the window to 10-6. I also plan on eating a little healthier too. 

Thank you all for the help and support. Now that I am not limited to the rules of the study, I will scout this sub for tips to improve results.

642,Set point problem?,"
I’ve noticed through years of losing and gaining weight that my body seems to really cling on for dear life when I get around 12 stone, and really puts up a fight going any lower no matter what I do. 

This time around my HW was 14.5 stone / 203lb (in May), the highest it has ever been CW is 11st 12.5. I have been doing really well and losing consistently 2-3lb on average a week since June. This week I have actually upped my exercise as I’ve started doing Couch to 5k on top of what I was already doing, and my eating habits haven’t really changed this week (doing very low carb mixed with 16/8 IF), yet my weight has not budged for 7 days now. I have had marginally more carbs than usual but not significantly (29% for this week versus 25% last week, when I lost 3lb)

Wondering what I can do to help with this! Will it sort itself out eventually if I keep doing what I’m doing? Is there anything else I can try to kick start it? I had a bit of a cheat week around 2 weeks ago which I thought would help but it doesn’t seem to have… Its so disheartening to be working so hard and not seeing any result, especially as I’ve got used to losing really well each week.

There I was cursing at my phones screen so I went ahead and actually commented post I had lurked on before, dropped positive comments that I had thought in my head but never actually shared, u know, in the posts themselves. To my surprise, the couple of comments I dropped around were really well taken and I felt like I made people happy, that made me incredibly happy. So I got up - I usually have dinner as my only meal - had lunch, met my calories and eat a bit of chocolate but I was feeling way better already (I guess I must have been actually hungry too). After that I continued with my daily routine, exercised and felt more energetic, I realized I perform better after having eaten, I know I won't be taken advantage of burning my very own fat while fasting, but I felt good. 
After all of these, I can now post in the community, realized I stand OMAD better when having my meal around past lunch time (4pm) and I'm truly thankful to be part of these amazing community that made me feel better even after being slapped in the face for not being able to post.

661,"Consistent IF (60 plus days) Vivid Dreams, and Sleep Struggles: Anyone Else?","For the past few weeks, I've noticed two main changes in my sleeping pattern:

My dreams have become much more vivid, and I remember them more frequently.

I'm finding it harder to fall asleep at night.

The only significant change in my daily routine is that I've been consistently practicing intermittent fasting and following a very-low carb diet.

While I've had episodes of insomnia in the past, this feels different. I'm not feeling particularly anxious or stressed, which usually are the reasons I can't sleep. Oddly enough, I don't even feel especially wired when I get in to bed at night, I'm actually usually pretty physically tired; I just struggle to fall asleep.

I'm sharing this to see if anyone else has experienced something similar and if there might be any helpful suggestions.  Maybe the calorie deficit is catching up with me?

665,Postpartum IF’ing doesn’t seem to be working,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice about why I am not losing any weight with IF.

 I’m not new to the process, I’ve been fasting in some form since about 2018-19. I started with 14 hour fasts and worked up to 16, and most recently I’ve been doing 18 hour fasts no problem.

 I’m about 10 months postpartum now. I started 16h fasting again towards the end of March/start of April. In the past month I have been able to up it to 18 hours about 3/4 days a week (weekends aren’t really conducive to fasting for me.) 

I also go for 2 kilometre walks about 2-3 days a week with the stroller, live on the third floor of an apartment building with only stairs, and carry heavy bags up and down at least once or twice a week. I’m also carrying my 20 pound baby around several times a day. I don’t drink alcohol on a regular basis (like maybe once every month or two) and I don’t eat sweets very often either. In the mornings while I am still fasting, I have a cup of black coffee with maaaybe half a teaspoon of sugar in it. I eat all home cooked meals as I live in a town with no fast food, and every meal includes a protein, rice or pasta or potatoes, and lots of vegetables. I time my fasts with an app.

Before pregnancy, I weighed 160lbs. My height is 5’7”. Now I weigh 170lbs, sometimes fluctuating week to week from 167-8 back up to 170. It’s not like I’m very overweight, but I am trying to lose a few pounds.

What gives? Do I need to fast more days during the week? Do I need more exercise? Should I cut out my coffee in the AM? Or do I just need to be more patient?",164m13t,6,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/164m13t/postpartum_ifing_doesnt_seem_to_be_working/,intermittentfasting

670,25M / 260lbs / IF is not working for me.,"I used to be 300lbs in high school and started IF in 2015. I lost over 110lbs by 2016 using a 16:8 regimen.

Flash forward to 2023 and I'm 260lbs (was 300lbs in January). Before starting IF, I cut out soda, ate less often, and ate healthier. Now, I'm trying to incorporate IF into my lifestyle again and it isn't working.

My typical 16:8 consists of not eating past 6pm, start eating at 10am. I eat one normal meal, throughout the day (if I eat more than that, I gain weight). I'm eating homemade meals consisting of high proteins such as ground beef and chicken. I drink plenty of water throughout my day.

As of lately, I've noticed my weight is staying exactly the same. I've started working out again and thought maybe it was muscle weight, but I haven't gained more than 0.05% muscle mass.

Any suggestions?

679,ADF-36 Hour Fast Every 3rd Day?,"Hey all, 

I have been experimenting with various versions of IF since February 2023. I started with 16:8 with a twice monthly 36 or 40 hour fast.

Some tough situations in life arose (got fired from my job unexpectedly, couldn't get approved for unemployment insurance so I was broke as I used my savings to catch up on bills etc) so I stress ate during that time. 

I am now back to fasting but I want faster progress. I don't want to do keto or any kind of specialized eating plan, but I have made up a new ADF schedule and I have been doing it for a solid month.

For 2 days in a row, I have an 8-10 hour eating window (between 11am-7pm or i extend it to 8pm or 9 pm on occasion) and I enjoy 2 meals and a snack or dessert (not non-stop eating) then on the 3rd day, I completely abstain from food and it turns into a 36 to 40 hour fast. So 2 days of eating during a window followed by a full day/night extended fast where only water and black coffee is consumed.

My exercise for now is a lot of walking, bit of light cardio and some strength training, and I do it when I feel up to it.

I have been doing it for besrly a month and I am honestly feeling so good. This schedule has killed off any desire to binge or stress eat and I am so thankful.

My only thing is, I am so impatient and I always doubt myself when I try something new. 

My question is.....if I stick with this, will the calorie deficit caused by cutting our a 3rd of the days I normally eat be enough to trigger decent weight loss? I am 5'2"" and I am in the 190s.

There are so many screwups and moments of self-discovery along the way. Forgiveness, perseverance and attempts at consistency are what’s required here but you gain instinctual patience in return.

682,I'm doing OMAD but I can't stuff myself enough to get to my goal calorie intake,"I'm using Myfitnesspal to track calories.

I also did IF (4-6 hour window) with Keto around 3 years back, did that for a year and a half without problems. Got off the diet and gained a lot of weight after I stopped going to the gym.

Recently got into cycling and absolutely love it, I'm quite motivated again to lose weight since it'll make me faster on the bike if I do it right.

So I've been doing OMAD for about 3 days now, 4 PM is my mealtime and I'm struggling to even get to 1500 calories much less 1800 which is what Myfitnesspal recommends. I ate about 900 calories and was stuffed, I ate a bit more than half my meal and had to power through it.

Add in the fact that I do about an hour of indoor cycling on the trainer every day and I'm way below my calorie goal.

Do I force myself to eat more? I can always reach for some ice cream and eat a cup or two of it for some fast and easy calories but with the focus on losing weight, I hate the thought of even doing it.

Intermittent fasting is crazy. I just broke a 40 hour fast with a 1.15 lb. (522 gram) delmonico ribeye steak with lots of butter and garlic, along with a literal pound of broccoli and I could not finish the steak. This wouldn't have even been an issue a few months ago. My stomach has obviously shrunken substantially and it seems like I cannot physically eat more than my TDEE in one go. Of what I could eat of the steak and broccoli, I only consumed 1,350 calories. And that's including all the butter! 

On top of that, in 45 days I have lost 22 lbs. or 10 kg. That's basically 0.5 lbs. or 0. 25 kg every single day. At this rate, I will be at my goal weight by spring. I haven't been able to lose this much weight this quickly, on purpose in a few years. This is awesome. Just wanted to share. 

I also had a quick question. When do you consider that your fast has begun? Do you consider it the moment you've stopped eating for the day?

686,"New to fasting, some questions","So I’m a 19 Male that started fasting last week to lose weight. (1,78cm 87kg starting and with a goal of 75kg for the moment).
I’ve already done a week, doing 16:8 with 2 big meals to start and finish and usually a snack in the middle.
I know it’s probably not accurated but today I weighted 86.3, meaning I lost around 0.7 kg in this week.
Finally, for context, in my country we space a lot lunch and dinner (around 7 hours) and my family usually do more, but I’ve been able to hit the 8hours max all week.

So here are the questions:
1) my 8hrs fasting may start 1 hour earlier or later than normal some days. I know it can make fasting of 17h or 15h. Does it have a big negative effect?

2) I should focus to do 2 big meals and avoid snacking in the middle right?

3) Soon I’ll start Uni again, where I spent normally 7-8hrs. I’ve been thinking but it will be hard to do 16:8 on uni days. Is it okay to do 14:10 on weekdays and go to 16:8 on weekend or will this have a negative effect on the fasting.

687,Combining 5:2 method with 16:8,"Hey everyone,

So for context, the 5:2 method I understand to be 5 days of non-fasting normal eating, with 2 non-consecutive days of very limited eating (500 to 600 calories). The 16:8 method is a consistent fasting schedule of 16 hrs fasting, with an 8 hour eating window. From what I hear 16:8 is one of the more popular methods given how unobtrusive it is. 

I tend to eat quiet a bit of food and so while I want to do the 16:8 method, I like the idea of having 2 days of deeper fasting to make sure there is some consistent weight loss week after week. 

So I was thinking about combining them and doing 5 days of a normal 16:8 fast with 2 days of limited 500-600 calories eating.

Does anyone see any issues with doing a fast like this? Would it be pushing it too much? 

Generally I like the feeling of fasting because o have IBS and having little food on my stomach tends to lead to a more pleasure life experience for me lol.

689,20/4 Meal!,"This chicken was amazing and so filling, so here is how I prepared it: 

I had the chicken breast soak in brine (just water with sea salt) in lukewarm water for 15 minutes on the counter (closed container). When it was done brining, I preheated the oven for 450 degrees. Then I got a pan and used avocado oil on it so the chicken wouldn't stick. I dried off the chicken from the brine and rinsed any excess salt from it. Then I put garlic, black pepper, and paprika on both sides of it, and rubbed it in. Cooked in oven for about 25 minutes, until internal temp was correct. (These chicken breasts were HUGE, it took a long time for them to cook even though it was at a very high heat. I bet medium or lower size chicken breasts only need 15-18 mins.) Side salad for fiber: Spinach, tomato, cucumber, and sliced pickled beets. Also not pictured here: I had organic spicy brown mustard to dip chicken in, was very good! I didn't use dressing for the salad, because I'm a freak and I like raw vegetables. Especially the vinegar taste from the beets gets on the other veggies anyways. 

I had another meal today in the 4 hour window, homemade keto cheddar broccoli soup. It was delicious but gave me a tummy ache because of the high fat content after fasting for so long. I did quite a lot of research on keto variation diets and intermittent fasting before beginning, but I wasn't aware that eating something fatty to break your fast can really mess up your stomach.

691,Switching it up is so important!,"Remember, your body can and does adapt. Instead of being strict, I've started mixing my fasting up to better results. I've been IF on and off for several years but this is the first time I've felt things were sustainable! I'm in perimenopause and the important markers like blood pressure, better sleep and gut health and my weight started to trend steadily in the right direction only after I became more flexible to let fasting fit into my life rather than fit my life into fasting.  Doing a strict fasting schedule was leading me to not fast more than fasting because it wasn't fitting my life.

For me:

\*The only general rule is that I don't eat past 6pm most days except for socializing  
\*I reserve OMAD for days I want to go out and eat with friends and not worry about calories or eat something that I love but I need to moderate (like homemade lasagna).

\*One week a month I shift my eating cutoff from 6pm to earlier (4pm usually) but I don't maintain that longer than a week for sustainability reasons (I don't eat early in the day so cutoff too early too often means my calorie restriction is too steep for it to be sustainable).

\*I do longer fasting (36 hours usually) several times a month (2-3 but no more). Sometimes I'll do 2 in one week, sometimes I do once a week for a few weeks- whatever works for my schedule.

\*I take breaks! If I'm busy or traveling or on vacation, I also take breaks.  I generally stick to the no eating past 6pm but depending will be more flexible and aim for no eating 4 hours before bedtime when needed during a break

A healthy habit is what you do most of the time, not that you are compliant 100% of the time!  Also a healthy habit is one where you get back on track after a break. Being too strict with fasting ruined fasting for me, being more flexible and having these rules helps me maintain my progress. I'm not low carb or keto and have managed positive trends (I do avoid processed food and eat a lot of veggies)!

I don’t work out (but I have a gym membership) I have no excuses for that but laziness but I’m going to change that. I’m down 15 lbs in 2 months. I can’t believe it. I could f***ing cry right now.

697,HELP needed! I'm going to fast 16/8 every day and doing keto + fruits menu. Is that a good idea?,"Hello friends. Let's start with some statements (before you would notice English is not my native language, so I'm sorry in advance for some strange phrases, that might occur in this post). Well, my statements, which I have grasped after 10 years of trying to lose weight and get rid of morbid obesity. 

1) I can't do classic keto forever though I can do it for long periods of time (weeks, months) but each time in the past I failed my ketosis binge eating some naughty carbs. 

2) I can't count calories, it drives me into drastic mental position and leads to being nervous and overeating before bedtime (checked 2 or 3 times).

3) I can't do 16/8 fasting without keto or LCHF, I'm a constant first day fasting rule breaker if I don't less carbs in my diet. 

4) I can't do OMAD in a long perspective, it makes me nervous. 

My situation seems so hard and I might seem to be so weak chicken (I weight about 135 kg / 297 lbs now) ... However, I'd like to give a go my own diet which is keto dishes + any fruits in an eating window + 16/8 IF. But no sugar and other carbs. I can't find any web notes about people doing that type of thing, so I hope ... I hope you EXIST and TELL me, if that is a good idea.... :) Thank you in advance.

703,Really hungry during eating window,"I (F25) started doing IF since 8/09 and began with the 12:12 approach which wasn't hard to do. I also eat lower carb and try to avoid all processed carbs.

I have been cycling these different schedules, and so far have been successful.

I resist the feeling and try to wait 3/4 hours until the next meal, but I would really like to know why it has been happening. Before committing to IF I already cut out snacking, kept to 3  meals that were 3/4 hours apart and was eating a high protein low card diet.

708,Good morning! First ever day of IF.,"First ever day of IF, last meal was yesterday around 4pm, it is 8:30am now. I'm about to head to the gym before work. I lead a sedentary lifestyle since I work remotely at home, and am an artist as a hobby. This morning I took ""Before"" pictures. I went to the doctor for my yearly physical a few weeks ago and was found to be around 80-100lbs overweight. I want to lose 100lbs, and be more muscular and fitter overall, and I know I can do it. I'm going to do IF, Keto, 4x/week exercise cardio + weight training, and CICO of course. I will use myfitnesspal membership to track calories and macros, this IF app to track meals, and my Fitbit to track anything else like water intake. 

Here's what I'm seeking advice for: first day back at the gym in awhile. I want to go regularly. Should I start slow? How long should I exercise for, I don't really know? When I used to be in shape and gym daily, I'd probably go anywhere from 1-2 hours, depending.

710,Unable to find maintenance sweet spot with IF and getting worried?,"I started IF a few months ago as it worked very well with my goals and lifestyle. I normally do OMAD - I really like having a strict schedule. I wasn't really insanely strict with it. I'd have a splash of oat milk in my coffee, maybe a teaspoon of sugar sometimes - simply because I was doing it mainly for weight loss and I didn't really get my hunger ""reactivated"" if I had some sugar in the coffee etc. 

All went well till about a month ago. I was 65 KG when I started, and I wanted to get down to 55 KG as I felt I looked best when I was at the lower end of BMI, I'm a 5'5 woman with a petite frame. My highest weight was 88KG in 2021, I lost 23 KG through generic CICO by May 2023. After OMAD, I got to 55 KG a month ago so I upped my calories to maintenance, but continued OMAD. 

I'm still tracking it well, and I've gotten even lazier with ""strictness"" - I'll have a coffee in the morning with milk and sugar, maybe a digestive biscuit or two at work - because I wasn't looking to lose any more weight, I just wanted to continue OMAD because I like and have gotten used to the schedule. 

But I'm 50 KG now! 4.5 kg lost in a month, even though I can swear I'm eating enough. I'm now considered underweight, and look it - people have been asking if I've been ill. I'm not sure what to do - for two weeks I even ate above maintenance and ate 1800 calories a day, but I've still been losing. And no, I have a sedentary job so I haven't exactly been running around with boxes in my arms, and I don't really exercise other than cycling to the shops lol. I also don't have any hormonal conditions, diabetes, or thyroid issues - I'm quite a blank slate, medically speaking.

At a loss of what to do - should I continue OMAD or stop it? I really don't want to stop doing it as it works so well with my lifestyle, and I've gotten very used to it. But I also don't want to lose any more weight, and my GP told me to stop doing IF as it was ""only for weight loss"". That didn't seem right to me, hence me asking here - please help! 

Thank you in advance!

IF plan: 18:6 during the week, 22:2 on the weekends

Exercise: No intentional exercise but I am a teacher and I’m on my feet most of the day. I also have my classroom on the 2nd floor so I’m up and down the stairs at least 4 times per day.

Diet: SAD but I’m trying to eat more veggies than I used to.

With losing so much weight, my face geometry is seriously changing and I am constantly nicking myself when shaving. I used to nick myself maybe once a month. Now it’s at least once per shave, which I do 3 times per week. 

All that said, I’m loving the weight loss. I’ve considered just growing a beard until I hit my goal weight, but it’s too hot for a beard and I love the way my shave soaps and such make me smell.

Hi all! I've been following discussions on this sub for a while now and have been interested in trying IF for myself, but my biggest concern is that I have recovered from a restrictive eating disorder and am not a fan of the thought of counting calories again.

As it stands, the circumstances which triggered my restrictive eating habits have changed and for two years I have been eating ""normally"" (not counting calories, mostly guiltlessly indulging in unhealthy food sometimes, trying to eat three balanced meals a day, etc..). As you can imagine, not rigorously controlling every bite I take has made me gain some weight, and I would like to shed at least five kilograms. 

(I am aware that IF is not a fad diet but a lifestyle change! I do want to keep the weight off and try to incorporate some workout into my routine too. )

2. What are the best apps to use to help say on track that are free? 

3. What type of changes do you make to your fasting days/hours (if any) if you are new to working out? Also what are good workouts to do in the gym for quick fat loss that won’t take too much out of you while fasting? 
 
4. If you like to drink on the weekends is there a type of alcoholic drink that won’t interfere too much with the weeks fasting? 

5. When you break your fast, no matter how long it’s been, what are the best things to consume for energy and feeling satisfied? 

I would like to know personal experiences with these answers. I’m not looking for opinions or things I can read on the internet. I think it’s best to find out what seems to work best for “most” people and go from there.

721,Intermittent Fasting Almost equals skipping breakfast??,"When I was a kid I was taught to never skip breakfast. Especially if you are trying to lose weight. Your body interprets that as starving so it tries to hold on to the fat. So for the first roughly 50 years of my life I always tried to eat three square meals at least. Preferably, I would sort of graze from when I got up until a few hours before bed. That was both healthy and the way to lose fat. At least that's what I read in a lot of books. Don't skip breakfast! Don't starve yourself!

However, I just realized today that for the first time in my life I am consistently losing weight. I expect the scale to consistently go down and it does. And I'm mostly doing it by only eating between roughly 10-11 AM and 6-7 PM. Given how early I often get up and how active I am during it, I am effectively skipping breakfast.

728,Results are finally showing from this summer! ( 220lb to 199lb in 45 days),"SW: 220lb
CW: 200lb
GW: 175lb


In Photo 1 I was 220lbs tired of looking overweight and always feeling bloated, heavy and constipated. I gave intermittent fasting a try after a lot of research online and on youtube and it seemed to be the only way to lose weight without having to go through crash dieting and overburdening and stressing myself. 

I started with 16 hours and then moved onto 18 hour fasting by the end of the first week. Managing to lose around 5 pounds of water weight in the first week. I was instantly surprised by the results since i was already feeling more fresh and active throughout my day while fasting. 

After 45 days of intermittent fasting, ( mainly consisting of 18 hour fasting 4 days a week and 3 days of OMAD 20-22 hour fasts) I started noticing massive difference in terms of my clothing sizes and body weight. Turns out, i now weigh just under 200 pounds which is pretty crazy to me. My clothes that would previously not fit me are now lose! My waist went from 38 inches to under 36 inches now and im feeling great!

I could not tell the difference until i took the second picture yesterday morning in the mirror. Most of my inflated belly is now gone and I am surprised by how all of this was possible in such a short amount of time. 

My GW is 175lbs and i would be starting the gym this month to make sure i build some muscle alongside losing all this fat. I did no real exercise during these 45 days and only focused on fasting along with occasional 30-40 min walks.",16335dd,524,22,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16335dd,intermittentfasting

Which approach do you think would be better on the days that I play pickleball?

Eat a big ass lunch and fuel up and only eat between 12-3. 
(I could def do this one if I ate enough. Just not sure if it’s healthy for my body to not get any nutrition after so much exercise.)

Or 
Move my eating window to 1:30-9:30. The downside here is that I would basically eat and go straight to bed which I also know isn’t good either.

(I guess it’s sort of hypocritical of me to consider it wrong in all circumstances but I think it’s a slippery slope with impressionable kids, and it’s more important to me that I teach them to eat a diverse diet and listen to their bodies at this age.)

However, these past 10 days I haven't lost a single kg and in fact I even gained almost 1.5kg (I don't feel the courage to check my measurements so I'll do that maybe after 2 weeks) I hold myself responsible for the fact that I wasn't doing IF properly these days and on the days I did, I wasn't staying in a calorie deficit. I also don't blame myself in anyway for any of these because I know that my mental health wasn't the best these past few days and it's also important to be kind towards myself.

• Eating something ""unhealthy"" at least once a day. It can be just a piece of bread with Nutella, a handful of potato chips, a few biscuits, a piece of dark chocolate or maybe even coffee with milk and sugar... I just can't help having something I really crave and I really need to work on it.

Anyways the commenters on that post gave me great feedback and my weight has been steadily decreasing since but I’m trying to avoid another plateau like the one I had at 184 lbs. The zig-zag caloric method takes a persons total weekly caloric intake and then breaks it up unevenly throughout the week so that you eat different amounts of calories daily but the same amount weekly so that your body does not grow accustomed to eating a fixed amount of calories daily thus creating the plateau. Have you guys tried this method or heard of it? What are your thoughts on it?

771,CICO or IF?,"Hi everyone.

I have started my weight loss journey for few weeks now.

I am doing keto diet, in IF manner. I do track my calories and macro. Additionally I am also lifting weights 5 days a week. I have been able to maintain this in very sustainable way and am quite happy except for I am not able to do strict IF. 

Right now I am trying to adjust to 16:8. I am still struggling to do 16:8 manly due to time constraints for my meal. I want to do strict 16:8 and then try to move towards 20:4 and eventually OMAD.

However, if I am already in deficit is it necessary for me to try do 20:4. Is there any significant advantages of having a smaller earing window?

774,Insulin Resistance / Folks Tracking Glucose,"I just bought a glucose and ketone blood monitor, and it’s making me question things. I’m doing 17:7 ish for about a month.  I have PCOS which makes me naturally insulin resistant and have about 40-50 pounds I need to lose. 

Last night, about 3.5 hours into my fast and about an hour before bed, my glucose was 102.   I woke up 13.5 hours into my fast this morning and the glucose was up to 108 without having eaten anything since last reading.  Odd, but I read online about the Dawn phenomenon and how hormones in the morning can spike glucose right before you wake up.  So that probably explains it.  No biggie.  

But then I fasted 17 hours total and glucose right before lunch dipped to 87.  Which is great and what I wanted.    An hour and a half after lunch it 89.  Great!  Stable glucose. No crazy spikes.  causing 

But then, I took it again 4 hours after lunch (about 3.5 hours fasted, no snacks or food since last reading), and it jumped to 111.   

So…. My question is….is anyone else seeing “delayed” glucose spikes?   Especially those with diabetes, prediabetes or insulin resistance?   

All the standard tests and recommendations say check your blood sugar 1-2 hours after meals.  So, if mine is stable then but doesn’t really jump until 4-5 hours after I eat, I find that odd.  

Is anyone else having this phenomenon in their blood glucose readings and if so —- any idea why this is happening?

Thanks in advance.  I’m gonna keep testing and experimenting, but I’m just perplexed why physicians are saying to check only 1-2 hours after eating if that’s not when my body is actually spiking.",161hvoc,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/161hvoc/insulin_resistance_folks_tracking_glucose/,intermittentfasting

I was only doing cardio in the summer but I began resistance training today. I did a 25 minute workout for core and arms and feel great and motivated. 

My plan from here on out is 20:4 five days a week, with weekends off while I’m socializing, although I will keep track of roughly how many calories I eat and try to stay below 1750 (around my TDEE on sedentary) and on days I fast I will eat around 1400-1500 calories. The deficit on its own should bring me down half a lb a week, although perhaps more depending how consistently I exercise. Plan is to do 2x a week resistance trainings and 2x a week cardio (45 mins on gym bike or 20 mins on stairmaster for now)

792,Lack of support bumming me out.,"I (51F, 5’5”, SW218, CW158, GW145) have been IF pretty strictly since February, and I’m currently down 60lbs. Unlike a lot of people, what works best for me is eating in the morning and fasting for the rest of the day so I go to bed with an empty stomach. It works for me, and even better, it’s been EASY for me to do. For the first time, I feel like I’m losing weight successfully without having to white-knuckle it through every day with a combo of willpower and strict calorie counting. 

The problem is that almost every social event I participate in involves eating in the evening. Family gatherings, birthdays, meeting friends at a restaurant for dinner, open air concerts with food trucks. The problem is not with me resisting the food, the problem is with everyone around me getting mad that I’m not eating. My sister is probably the worst of the bunch. 

We live very enmeshed lives. We live on the same block, raised our kids together, pretty much do everything together, along with my husband. We joke that she’s his “sister wife” because they sometimes do more things together than he and I do (my job often involves working in the evenings, theirs do not, so if I can’t join them at a social event or bike ride with the kids, the two of them just go together and I have zero issue with that)

My sister is divorced and while a little overweight, she is very healthy, active, and quite comfortable in her skin. She thinks diets are crap and we should all just do intuitive eating, eat healthy foods, and accept our bodies as they are.

That’s fine, but *I* was desperately unhappy being obese. I’m an athlete in my heart, and when I was 220lbs, I just felt like I was wearing a fat suit. I couldn’t do the things I wanted to do, and the person in the mirror didn’t seem like me. 

I told my family when I started IF that I was going to be VERY strict about it until I reached my goal weight/range (140-150). Then I would relax the rules a bit and keep IF on regular days, but eat in the evenings during social situations. 

The problem is that my sister is constantly making passive aggressive and sometimes downright mean comments any time we’re together and I don’t eat. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve declined a serving of something by saying, “No thanks, I can’t eat in the evening” just to have her declare, “Yes, you CAN eat in the evenings, you’re just CHOOSING not to!”

True, but she knows why, she knows how much happier I am since I’ve been losing weight, but every time I’m with her during evening meals (which is probably 50% of all evenings), she has to make a comment about how stupid it is to not eat. Keep in mind, she had done IF before herself, but she fasted in the morning. Apparently that’s not a problem for her, but me fasting in the evening is.

Last night I felt so defeated. She made dinner at her house (across the street from mine). She let us all know food was ready, and two of my kids went over to eat. My 15-yr-old son texted me soon after and asked if I was coming to hang out, and that he thought my sister wanted me to. I hadn’t gone over because sometimes if I’m particularly hungry, hanging out around the smells of a delicious meal while everyone else eats is just kind of hard. This wasn’t a special meal, just a regular weeknight. However, I went over to visit, didn’t say anything about eating/not eating, take one portion to save for my meal the next morning, and thought that was it. Later, my son mentioned to me in passing, “(sis’s name) thinks you care more about losing weight that you care about your family.”

I’m not going to blow up my relationship with my sister over this, but it just makes me sad that the person I’m probably closest to in the world (yes, I’m definitely closer to her than my husband, but that’s a post for an entirely different sub!) seems to be trying to sabotage me, or at the very least make me feel bad/wrong about fasting.

796,"Losing Weight, Gaining Self Control","I (30f) have been researching fasting on and off for years, working up to some 72 hour fasts and skipping breakfast here and there but nothing consistent enough to monitor results.

I have been between the same 15-20 pounds for the past EIGHT years. And that is just what I can track with my apple weight app. I haven’t been under 200 pounds for as long as I can remember. 

I started doing Twomad and OMAD and 20:4 and I think I’ve finally found my sweet spot. The best part is that it feels natural for me. Drinking water, unsweetened tea, and focusing on how to get the most protein into my only meal for the day is something I can see myself doing for the rest of my weight loss journey and even into maintaining my weight once I reach it. At 225 and 5’8, I only want to lose about 45 pounds total.

The reason I’ve never been able to see results in those 8 years is because I didn’t understand CICO, didn’t care for meal timings, emotionally ate, and wasn’t consistent with ANYTHING. Also, homeostasis lol. I’ve been consistent for the past week eating this way and I’m so excited.

I just wanted to share how excited I was about feeling this is going to work this time around. I want to be able to look back at this post and see that consistency was the missing puzzle piece all along, and it’s all smooth sailing from here on out.

IF is an intermediary, ""just"" helping people to maintain caloric deficit by making them more aware of what they are eating, more protein and fats, which makes people more satiated and kess likely to eat carbs in the firm of junk.

So, is that actually how this works?

799,"Doing 2 meals a day instead of 4, volume of food is lower as well. Is oil, salt, or something else the culprit here?","I regularly intermittent fast 14-16 hours a day and eat 4 meals a day, 1 small one pre workout and 3 post workout. I regular track calories and have a pretty good estimate of calories just by looking at the food I'm eating.

I'm now on vacation. I'm working out less and using this as an opportunity to take a 2 week active recovery period. So I'm still lifting, but less weight, and still doing the same cardio (30 minutes of walking a day). There is no way for me to track my food since I'm visiting my extended family and they are cooking so instead I eat lunch and dinner with my family and nothing else. This gives me an eating window of about 5-6 hours and the rest of the day is fasting.

I've noticed that during this trip, I am getting more flabby and appear to be gaining body fat. However, by just observing what I'm eating, I am not sure how. I have one small bowl of rice with lunch and dinner (bowl a small one that my fist can barely fit into and I fill about half of it with rice). I typically meal prep rice on my normal diet and the rice I've been eating is about 1/3 in visual volume compared to what I normally eat. Besides that, I've just been eating whatever vegetables (usually brocolli) and meat are provided on the table, usually chicken or beef, but occasionally seafood like shrimp or similar that I don't know the name of. In terms of meat, I do my best to eat around 8oz of meat with each meal, purely visualizing. Besides these two meals, I did bring protein powder with me and have one scoop before each meal which roughly brings my total protein intake to high enough to just maintain.

The only thing I cannot account for is I can tell everything is way more seasoned than what I normally eat and is also cooked in a decent amount of oil. But I can't imagine oil to add that many more calories. I also thought it could be the sodium, since my typical diet doesn't have too much sodium and I'm actually sweating way more during my light workouts here vs my higher intensity ones back home. Finally, I can honestly say I haven't been hungry this entire trip. I'm eating just to spend time with my family, but I could probably skip lunch too (already skip breakfast). It's odd because back home, I'm literally ravenous after each meal regardless of how much I eat, and visually it looks like I'm eating less here than at home. How is it possible I'm slowly gaining body fat?",16108u8,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/16108u8/doing_2_meals_a_day_instead_of_4_volume_of_food/,intermittentfasting

812,Interrupting/ pausing my fast?,"Hi all, Just looking for a little advice on how you’d go about the following:

I currently fast 16/8, and my eating window is roughly 12pm to 8pm. Within that window i normally consume between 1200-1400 calories.

I have a night out planned for tomorrow, and obviously the time we’d be out would be within my usual fasting time. I wouldn’t be eating as i’d have done that within my eating window however i’d estimate i’ll probably get through at least 750 calories while i’m drinking. I wouldn’t want to start my fast when i finish drinking because that could be anything between 12am-4am, meaning i wouldn’t be able to eat until 4pm the next day at the earliest.

i’m thinking the best way to do it would be to just ignore my fasting period tomorrow night while i’m drinking, carrying on with my eating window at normal, and then starting my fast again at 8pm on saturday?
 
I haven’t been fasting for long, so it’s not like i’d be disrupting a set in stone routine, however i’d still love to know the best way to minimise the disruption!",160jdm0,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/160jdm0/interrupting_pausing_my_fast/,intermittentfasting

841,Help with IF Schedule,"Hey everyone. My (36m) schedule is going to drastically change next week and I’m overthinking how to implement IF with this new change. The biggest factor is that I will be starting a second job, which means I will be awake from 2:00am all through 7:00pm. And this second job is laborious. My concern is…

A: will I have enough energy to last the whole day by doing IF.

B: this 2am-7pm schedule is on Mon, Tue, Weds. Saturdays I just have to be up 2:00am till 2pm but that’s all due to my second job, basketball and gym. I’d like to push my IF schedule on days that I’m not up as much. Is this healthy/ safe?

C: I also go to the gym 4 days a week, will be in the gym 1.5 hours max. My cardio will be my second job, but I do play basketball Tuesdays and Saturdays which will leave me with 5 hours of sleep Tuesday into Weds (I do not want to give up basketball lol). Again is IF a suitable lifestyle with all this activity. 

IF worked wonders for me earlier in the year. I lost 33lbs in 3 months thanks to IF and not drinking alcohol. But summer has been filled with frolicking and drinks, so I wanna get back into my healthy habits but I’m stressing on whether it’s even possible.

Now a different kind of a vent:

I got recommended using apple cider vinegar for helping with cravings and I'd like to happily report that this is a miracle worker!

I'm so FUCKING STOCKED about it!!!

As I've posted before, cravings in the last hour(s) of my fasts end up leading me to a pitfall of binging and eating crap straight when my eating window opens.

Now to my recent IRL moment:

An hour away of my eating window and I'm trying to build up the strength to NOT end the fast in an unhealthy way. I had sipped through my water bottle that had a table spoon of this mystical potion called apple cider vinegar mixed in.

Co-worker enters the room with fast food and immediately the smell of a goddamn burger and greasy french fries enter and fill the room...

But.. I just smell it. No change in my mood, my ""hunger"", my thoughts except: ""ok he's having a burger"". My salad with some tofu waits me to be devoured. And I plan to destroy that salad, and just leave it there. There is a vending machine in our office with all the ""good stuff"", but fuck them I'm gonna laugh at the machines face and tell it to go fuck itself!

I know this may seem small to some, but to me this is a huge deal and I dare to say that I'm not alone. The smell's of junk food tend to trigger a snowball effect that many of us struggle with. Not saying that this is the answer for everyone. There are other triggers as well, but I'm so happy that this one bastard of a trigger seems to have withered away.

Sorry if this post doesn't have the correct flair or if it's too ""vulgar"", but this feeling of excitement, drive, ""anger"", happiness and clarity is something I just can't contain.

I tagged this as NSFW, please let me know if it's not needed.

857,Feeling discouraged,"Hello, just needed to rant.

 I started intermittent fasting a little over a month ago. I generally stop eating at 8/ 9 pm and break my fast around 12/ 1 pm. I have a corporate job where i sit down majority of the day but i do go to the gym about 5 to 6 days a week where i have a mix of weight lifting and 10-20 mins of cardio. In the mornings, i stopped my starbucks runs and started drinking black coffee or anything caffeinated i can find with no calories/sugar/carbs [at the very least minimal in all categories]. For a while i did start losing weight and now i feel like ive been stagnant or watching my weight increase on the scale. It has only increased about 2 lbs but it is still discouraging when I'm genuinely trying. I've been really good about minimizing both sugars and carbs. I also increased the amount of protein in my diet and healthy fats. I've been more conscious about reading labels and just stopping with the late night fast food runs. 

My birthday is coming up and the only thing i want to do is go ham on a slice of cheesecake but at the same time it feela like i dont even deserve it watching the scale go right back up. I know i havent been doing IF that long but its just hard to keep pushing forward. What has helped you stay motivated? 

For reference, I'm a soon to be 27 year old female. 229 lbs. I started at 235 but dropped to 227 and it recently increased and hovers between 229-230. Please be nice or dont say anything at all.

I've been doing IF for 5 years now. I'm doing 16-8 which means I've been keeping breakfast. Everything is great. After losing 11lbs, my weight has been under control by fasting.

Lately, I've taken up running. Before, I didn't do much exercise. After 4 months, I decided to increase the intensity and frequency of my run. I always run during an eating time not during fasting time as I'm afraid I don't have much energy during that time frame.

Now, I start feeling hungry in the morning which never happened before. I tried consuming more food during lunch and evening but after that many years, my stomach can't bear that much intake.

860,Interesting unexpected effects.,"So first off sorry if I'm not using abbrivations or have no idea what I'm talking about but this is just my notes in what's happened with me. 

 I'm a hoover(vacuum cleaner) when it comes to food so I really didn't understand how people could starve themselves to death. 

But I heard about a guy who just stopped eating until he lost a huuuuge amount of wieght becuase after 3 days once his fat reserves started feeding him his body stopped nagging him for food. 
So I have it a go, got to 1 day then fell off and binged
Struggle to get past 1 day always binging, the suddenly got to 2.5 days... 
Then struggle for ages then suddenly made it to 3 day with ease but then had a massive binge. 
Was planning to make that last attempt to 4 days to see if that 4th day was as easy as it was said to be when I discovered intermitant fasting. 

I may return to that one day but from my initial results IF is really interesting. 

I chose 1:1 as I know I can do 24hrs with reasonable ease. 

So on day 6 (fast 3) I dropped fasting as my other half wanted to go burgerking. 

Wierd thing is after the meal I feel I could have sat and watched them all eat but I was glad we ate together. 
It did however mess me up for 3 days where I over ate on fast days. 

The second wierd thing is I get full MUCH quicker now during feed days. I tended to overeat becuase I ate fast meaning I took on many calories between being full and the I'm full signal going of. 

The third wierd thing happened today.
Day 16
 I was fasting when I accidentally hit my head, very gentle but the angle causes a superficial but bloody cut. 
Well becuase of the location and the blood it thought best to stop fasting, I headed out and grabbed a bacon roll and latte. 
As I rode home I thought well I've failed fasting today, let's have a burger to go with my, bacon, large lunch, snacks..... And then I realised I hadn't had anything except the roll and latte. I'd skipped lunch without feeling hungry and snacking 
Did some maths and I'd not breached the 500 calorie goal for a fast day... So I drove straight home. 

So I'm going to stick with this 1:1 now. 

Started 87kg
Bp at 120 over 90 somthing
Resting heart rate 68. 

Now 84kg(different scales so not sure)

862,"How do you guys do it? I try not to eat, then cave and binge.","**Edit:** Wow I didn't expect so many responses, thankyou everyone. That in itself Is motivating.

**It seems the main takeaways are:**

- To change the times that I'm fasting so that I'm doing the majority of it while asleep. Also to start smaller and build up.

- Drink water/tea/electrolytes/some kind of 0 sugar beverage when I think I'm hungry. Perhaps even shitloads of it.

- Limit carb intake overall and mainly to veggies. Try to eat high protein and fats.

- Distract myself, especially around that time period where I start to get aches. Put distance between myself and food, do chores, go for a walk etc

- HTFU. Stick with it, keep trying, eventually if I keep trying it will catch on.

**Original post below**:

I have been trying to build up to a more intense fasting regime.

I had thought to myself, ""I just won't eat until 2pm to start then I'll try and eat normally and then after I can do that I'll push it back later"".

The problem is, I get to about 12pm and my stomach is aching! Like feels like it's actually hurting. So I cave and eat to stop the pain. My brain literally can't focus on anything other than the discomfort.

Then I will eat like 5 meals before 10pm. Like proper meals too. The same amount of food as if I had just eaten from the start of the day and sometimes more.

How do you train yourself to do it? I really want to lose some weight and increasing my exercise wasn't doing it because I just eat more on days when I do exercise (because of the hunger pains).

I'd like to give OMAD a shot, but I find my usual water-fast experts have less to say about intermittent fasting. Whereas there was a ton of info on how water fasting works, it gets more generic on intermittent fasting. In particular, **how much** do I eat?

I read about people eating their entirely daily quantity of calories in a single meal- 1500 cals to 2000 cals depending. Which feels counter intuitive to me. But when I went to try to Dr Fung (and other fasting doctors whis names I can remember) for information, quantity of meal is omitted. It seems to me that I should eat a regular single meal, not gorge myself.

Diagnosed MCAS and ME/CFS.

Lost a few pounds- obviously water weight and whatever was hiding in my guts.

Started 16:8 and then moved to 18: 6 as i got no results. I gained a few pounds in the first 2 days then it started slowly going down by half a pound daily. 

Not looking too hard into macros at this stage as I cannot have histamine or anything acidic. I haven't had coffee for 2 years so I'm.always angry. LOL. I'm just trying to keep to the fasting regimine as I'm also an emotional eater. 

What I found helpful was doing everything in pounds. I'm an Aussie living in the EU so I'm used to metric but I find for some weird reason, the kilos trigger a panic in me if it doesn't move, so the lbs thing, kinda feels like small victories.

Suggestions, particularly re: how to make sure I’m getting *enough* calories/protein during my feeding window would be greatly appreciated! Also, best to workout right before I break fast or during my feeding window?


Stats: 36F, CW 190, Goal 170. I was steady at 175 then nose dived “after” the pandemic. 

WLS patient — gastric sleeve. Several years post-op. Out of the “honeymoon” phase.

Considerations:
- Typically sleep 12am - 7am and have breakfast around 10am, sometimes later.
- Because of my stomach restrictions, I can usually only eat between 4-8oz, or a fist sized plate, of food at a time (depends on the type of food) 
- I’ve been protein deficient and have been focused on getting that back up. I need to be hitting 100-150g / day
- I’m light on fitness right now, but increasing movement every day and will hopefully be back to 3-4x week once my tendinitis subsides.
- Fitness is mix cardio/strength, think floor Pilates and dance-inspired movement 
- In September, I’ll be back in the office 3 days a week, usually from 10/11am until 4pm
- Hunger before bed is what I’m aiming to avoid because I can’t handle that. Late night snacking is what usually gets me (because of my small portions, if I eat at 6pm I’m definitely at least a little hungry around 10pm)


This is a lot of info, but hopefully useful! I’m aiming for 16:8 and will trial and error to figure out what works.

884,"Another question from the ""new newbie""","I already got some insight to my tendency to wake up way too early in the morning and I could not be more thankful to this community.

I know it may have seemed like a small thing, but to me this journey is THE thing that I took on to change my life for the better at last.

A little description of my current situation:
I'm a 193cm (I guess that would be 6 ft 4 inches(ish)) male and my starting weight last friday was 139,4kg (Around 307 lb).

Target weight 105kg for this program, then the  aim is to get to 95kg.

I started my 16:8 (program runs to July 2024) last friday, but the following notes also reffer to my previous 16:8 attempts, of which there have been around 3.

I tend to spend my time fasting quite easily, not even thinking of food (healthy or not) but as I get to my last hour I start to crave all the ""good stuff"". Emotional/psychological eating seems to be the biggest issue.

Occasionaly (around 1 out of 3 or 4 times) I get quite the opposite: I want to push the 16 hours to longer and end up going 17 or 18 hours. 

I've decided to take on these struggles one by one. 

Any advice or thought excercises to tackle the issue I have with the moment of breaking the fast?
Food recommendations would also be much appreciated.

Thanks again everyone!

889,Journey to 1000 fasts and a healthier me - my personal experience with intermittent fasting,"Hey everyone!

As I approach my 1000th logged fast, I find myself reflecting on the journey that's brought me here. From struggling with obesity, difficulting breathing and sleep apnea,  alarmingly high blood pressure, and cholesterol issues, to achieving a stable weight of 85kg (from 98kg when I started) and enjoying optimal health, the transformation has been incredible.

The Start:
Like many, I was initially skeptical and unsure about fasting. But after much research and experimentation, I found a routine that resonated with me. I started out very simply, by just eating dinner at a normal hour and not eating anything beyond 8pm. Then I oscillated between 16:8, 18:6, and even incorporated 36-hour monk fasts. And yes, there were the days when I didn't make it, but I consistently logged every fast for the last 2.5 years. Currently, I'm in the midst of my longest fast ever, over 60 hours, a challenge I feel prepared for thanks to my previous experiences.

The Challenges:
The road wasn't always smooth. There were times when I fell short of my goals, days when social commitments made adherence difficult, and moments of doubt. But I learned not to be too harsh on myself. After all, fasting is a way of life, not a punishment.

The Success:
Here's what makes the journey all the more rewarding:
* Weight Loss & Maintenance: Through consistency and perseverance, I managed to lose weight and have maintained it at a stable 85kg.
* Blood Pressure Control: Once plagued by ridiculously high blood pressure, I now enjoy a normal, controlled level. No more sleepless nights worrying about my heart health.
* Cholesterol in Check: My cholesterol levels, too, have improved significantly.

The Power of Exercise:
Incorporating exercise, especially while fasting, amplified my results. From incline walking and lifting weights, physical activity accelerated my weight loss and enhanced my overall well-being.

The Importance of Hydration:
Hydration became a cornerstone of my success. I found that sparkling water with its effervescence helped suppress my appetite during fasting periods. Understanding your body's hydration needs is crucial, as it supports digestion, energy levels, and overall health.

The Tools:
I attribute part of my success to the tools I've used, like the Zero app. Its trend analysis and reminders have been instrumental in keeping me on track.

The Takeaway:
My journey towards 1000 fasts has been enlightening and transformative. The ups and downs have taught me patience, resilience, and the importance of listening to my body. There's no one-size-fits-all in this journey, and that's the beauty of it.

Diet Amplification (A Future Focus):
While I've come far, my journey is far from over. Going forward, I plan to delve deeper into diet amplification, exploring nutrient-rich foods and understanding how they can further fuel my body. A balanced diet, especially during eating windows, is key to sustaining the gains from fasting.

I share this not to boast, but to inspire. Your path might differ, but the destination of a healthier life is within reach. Trust the process, and embrace the journey. You've got this!

Feel free to ask me anything about my experiences. I'm here to support and learn from this fantastic community!

892,Is 16:8 worth sticking to? Success stories?,"I (F, age 27) started 16:8 fasting last week for 5 days a week because I need to lose about 40 pounds for health reasons. I am 5’1 and weigh about 185 (my highest weight) and have PCOS. My weight is concentrated in my mid-section. I have tried many things and have had little success. Ive heard great things about IF and decided to give it a try. 

It’s obviously very early, so I am still having major hunger waves - mostly at night a couple of hours after dinner and then around breakfast. Trying to stick it out by loading up with water. It has been OK, but again, it’s only been about 7 days of fasting and I did not fast over the weekend. 

Has anyone had significant weight loss success with 16:8? 
If so, do you have any tips? 

I read some recent posts and it seems like the major weight loss was accomplished through OMAD or 20:4 or much longer fasting periods. I just don’t know that I can sustainably tolerate fasting for any longer periods. Basically reaching out for success stories to see if 16:8 is a viable and sustainable way to lose weight… the scale hasn’t budged yet but I don’t expect to see any results for at least a month, as my PCOS causes extreme difficulty with weight loss.

Is my belly an apron belly? I only heard of the term the first time today. 

For those who have experienced apron belly, and reached your goal weight, were you able to get rid of it? 

I was looking at old late teens and early 20s pictures, back when I was 115, and would like to look similar. I also plan on getting a breast reduction when I hit 135, too. 

I MIGHT have PCOS per my doctor, and it has been a bit difficult to lose weight. I do need to start exercising by putting together my elliptical. I know we can't target weight loss, but I imagine cardio might reduce the belly?

I usually work out 3x a week, first thing in the morning (6am) because it’s what my schedule allows for. I’ve tried intermittent fasting before — with a 12-8pm eating window —  but had always avoided doing it on my workout days because I was worried about muscle loss / protein degradation if I didn’t replenish with food after my workout. Something about a prior recommendation to make sure you get protein 30-40 min after the gym for best results. 

My question is, can I just not consume that protein until 12pm if I want to fast on those days too, or would that be a detriment to gym progress? On the one hand doing IF ~4 days a week isn’t bad, but I’m wondering if I’d be better off for trying to burn fat if I was doing it 7x a week and just continuing my fast until 12pm on gym days.

Is anyone tracking micronutrients? On 16:8, it is really easy for me to get enough of my macros. I honestly get worried about being so full of protein that a big ol’ serving of veggies or fruits doesn’t even sound appealing.

I realize it can be a “quality of carbs” convo. I’m just curious how others have handled it. 

I’d love to be able to conquer this without tracking my food in an app. I’m not interested in seeing caloric info.

Daily weigh-ins are one strategy that people use, and I find it extremely interesting as it allows you to see the trend line even if your weight swings wildly with carb intake, exercise and water weight.

So I dont really have any control on the food. Dont get me wrong im not complaining about this im grateful for this. 

I am trying to lose some weight and have told my mum this but since she likes cooking I havent asked to change the meals or anything. I have just significantly reduced the amount I eat. If previously I ate a whole plate of rice I have reduced it to 1/4 of the plate.

For some instances where I do have control on the meals I have simply skipped them such as lunch when I am at school or sometime breakfast because I woke up late/early before she has had a chance to make the meal I simply say I've had a sandwich or a fruit.

I guess my question is would eating only at dinner a small portion of whatever is served still end up at a deficit helping weight loss or is it still heavily dependent on the meal? if the meal is still something like rice with a side dish?

968,Fasting and hypoglycemia,"Just for context: 18F 164lbs 5’8”

And to preface I have a metabolic neuromuscular condition.

Prior to starting intermittent fasting I dealt with reactive hypoglycemia after eating breakfast. I would do ok with lunch and dinner but breakfast did me in. I started drinking a sole source nutrition shake for breakfast in the hopes that it would help prevent the hypoglycemia, which it did. When I started the intermittent fasting I stuck with the shake for breakfast, eating around 8am and then would fast for 9-10 hours, eating dinner at 5 or 6. I know this isn’t the traditional way to do intermittent fasting but because of my neuromuscular condition it’s what works. I have been able to avoid any issues with hypoglycemia despite not eating for so many hours.
Today I had a coffee around lunch time after eating breakfast as I normally do and subsequently developed hypoglycemia. I never had issues with drinking/eating at lunchtime causing this issue before I started intermittent fasting and I was really just curious to know why it happened now that I’ve been doing intermittent fasting?

My Problem: Next week we will be driving down for a two week trip through Italy. What or how should I do this? 

Do I say F*&% it and just eat my way through the 2 weeks, stick to my current OMAD plan, or do something else?

985,ADF meals for maximum fat loss?,"I am a 38yo male currently 240 and have a goal of dropping 40lbs. As I am typing this, I am about 30 hours into a fast, and plan to open my eating window at 40 hours. I am not totally sure what I should eat during the eating window though if I want to maximize fat loss. Is it helpful to try to stay low carb during this time to make it easier to get back into ketosis, or should I eat a good amount of carbs during this time to replenish glycogen stores again before the next fast?",15w37gs,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/15w37gs/adf_meals_for_maximum_fat_loss/,intermittentfasting
986,Struggling...,"F - 36, 5'0, SW - 180, CW - 162, GW - 125

I did a 67 hour fast at the start of the month. Longest fast I've ever done, normally I do 20-24 hours fasts. With some 16 and 30 hour fasts mixed in. I've noticed since then it's becoming increasingly difficult to even go 12 hours without feeling absolutely miserable. I have to push myself daily to make it to my OMAD mark. I just broke a 14 hour fast tonight.

I have been exercising daily this past week on my new treadmill and I know I don't need to exercise with OMAD, but I am doing it to get my body healthy and to also make it so I can enjoy a daily cup or 2 of coffee with cream and sugar. I've lived a rather none active life over the past 12 years. I'm not going too crazy with the exercise, but I still want to continue using the treadmill for health reasons and maybe a little extra push with my weight loss journey.

I'd like any advice or pointers as to why it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep fasting since my 67 hour fast.",15w373n,11,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/15w373n/struggling/,intermittentfasting

990,i’m really struggling right now,"i was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at the age of 12. i’m 22 now and (finally) weight restored. recovery has gone decently so far (i just made it to the 7 month mark a few days ago!), but i’m scared that this won’t be the last time i’ll have to go through this. i’ve been weary about it since i was admitted to the hospital last fall, to be quite honest.
over the last couple of months, i’ve noticed this really intense paranoia creeping up on me when i think about the weight i’ve gained back so far. it has become more and more tempting to give into the taunting little voice in my head that tries persistently to rationalise relapsing again.
it’s often hard as hell to get through those periods, but.. sometimes i picture younger me, this little, innocent little boy who dreamed of being invisible, of taking up as little space as possible. no child deserves to feel like that. not a single one. i’m fucking starting to cry as i write this.
when i began my most recent round of treatment for my eating disorder, i told my therapist that i was “doing this for little me.” and i meant it, because that little boy doesn’t deserve to die.

idk i’m just in a really confusing place with everything right now. i’m bipolar and currently in a depressive episode. every time i begin overthinking, which is pretty often, my brain is telling me not to just restrict, but to starve myself so i can just die.

i have permanent health issues from a decade of anorexia and each year, i’m at a higher and higher risk of dying from this disease.

i’m tired and scared and i need a hug idk man.",16ng56v,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16ng56v/im_really_struggling_right_now/,AnorexiaNervosa
991,Feeling desperate,"So, I gave in to my thoughts again a few days ago, and i'm not proud of myself but I've been dealing with trauma and i don't know if you can relate to me but Anorexia is a way to numb my feelings. I decided to commit recovery a year ago, but instead of that I just gained weight for a person not for myself, once that person went away I felt gross and suicidal, then after a long time of not seeing me, they pointed out all my looks and weight gain then told me to not let myself get fat, i felt so triggered and out of control, I'm not proud of what I'm doing but I feel that I can't stop starving by now, still at a healthy weight which makes me feel even more desperate. Just want to end me, tbh. I don't feel good and feel my bones hurting, wish i could stop depending emotionally on narcicistic people all the time.",16ncigp,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16ncigp/feeling_desperate/,AnorexiaNervosa
992,I'm so tired of being screwed over by psychiatry,"So for context i live in a rural area with minimal MH options and I live too far from my previous ones to utilise them, which has led me to begin the fucking painful journey of getting a new care team.

My bloods are abnormal, my weight/bmi is low (and getting worse) i'm having shitty health complications and I've been triaged to the highest ability of doctors, nurse practitioners and general health services without being sent to IP. However, the fucking psychologist (who is the only one who's qualified in EDs) doesn't do meetings without a phone assessment first. She is in the office one day a week! A singular day! I have referrals from multiple places and yet i have to play catch up with her and she's never there or busy with another client and I'm so tired. She is the only one that can give me the services i need but i just feel so dejected because she's only ever called when I'm in another appointment with someone else , even the she knows the fucking times.

The NP is concerned, Dr is concerned but like the one person who can actually help isn't. Like i know it's not entirely her fault but i just feel like im being avoided cause I'm not sick enough and she doesn't think i am. At this point the rest of the care team are tempted to try to send me to IP just so I'll have better care but that's the extreme case (even though i do qualify for it). 

I just want to get worse and I'm tired of trying - pushing myself to go to every appointment just for the main actual chance for psychiatric help is not there.

Edit for some extra context: to be sent to IP i would have to be sent over an hour from where i live and to move through this quicker, i would have to have private health insurance - which i can't afford so this is really all i have access to currently.",16nbsao,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16nbsao/im_so_tired_of_being_screwed_over_by_psychiatry/,AnorexiaNervosa

I’m thinking it’ll just go away or back to a normal amount when the vaccine side effects wear off so I told myself not to worry. I never had heart palpitations before I developed my eating disorder. I was anorexic for about 4 years then decided to recover but it’s been very slow going, I gained a small amount of weight but I’m still underweight.

998,When should you start challenging fear foods in recovery?,"I've just started my recovery journey after months of being too scared.

  
I had a wakeup call tonight when the doctor said I had two options: admission with NG tube or I do this myself and choose what I eat, as long as I hit the calories. My weight will be updated weekly and if I go any lower i'll immediately be admitted.

  
I want to do this, I want to try and hold myself accountable and hit my calorie goal, despite currently being on an exercise ban. I'm exhausted and I don't want to live like this anymore. 

  
My diet is currently restrictive, but I am trying to hit the calories. I have a lot of fear foods / foods that I avoid. I don't feel comfortable eating these yet, especially in big quantities, but I am open to the idea of challenging a fear food once a week or one every few weeks.

1005,I’m afraid that university will make me relapse,"This is the third year of my bachelor’s degree and I feel like I’m already drowning:

There’s never enough time to do everything and I don’t know how to keep up. I’m already exhausted and want to crawl into bed and hide until spring. The weather’s getting colder and I can’t bring myself to eat more. The headaches are getting more frequent and I’m getting weaker. 

I’m taking an into class to advanced math and even though I logically understand all the concepts, my answers are often wrong and I feel so stupid. It feels like everyone else thinks differently and I don’t understand their thought processes at all and they don’t understand mine. It’s so hard to even think and the brain fog and stomach pain are killing me. 

Usually I gave up on attending classes in October and I don’t know how to keep going to class until the end of the semester. I go to class, then I’ll have less time for studying and will be way more tired. If I don’t, it’ll be harder to keep track of everything. 

I have no idea how I’m going to survive this semester. There’s so much pressure and I’m exhausted. Last year I ended up in the hospital at the end of the first semester and had to drop half of my classes in the second. 

I’m so envious of all the students around me who aren’t constantly starving or panicking because they’re not starving and can think clearly and don’t get exhausted from attending one class and can bring themselves to talk to others.

it's been a week. i feel so empty. literally. i keep telling myself i wont eat until things get better, but i secretly hope they don't. i just want the voices to take me already. im so tired of fighting.

i dont know. can succumbing to this really be that bad? i know life has its ups and downs and maybe theres another few good days left ahead for me... but are they really worth fighting for? it's been so long since ive been happy i can't remember the last time. 

i went through my last recovery alone. of course people noticed the dramatic weight loss but nobody cared. i was dying right in front of them and nobody cared. i felt so pathetic and just wanted to prove to myself that i was strong. i dont think i can do that again.. not without actual physical help.

im very grateful when i can get words of encouragement online when i can, but that can only go so far. i think i need someone to physically shovel dirt in my mouth.

i wonder how long it will take. maybe i should lay myself out on the public bench that way someone calls emergency services when things start to rot.

1018,I’ve slipped back to my old habits very quickly,"I could somewhat see it coming but I don’t know what to do and I’m scared.

I was okay with my weight. Then suddenly I wasn’t. I think with maintenance for months or the perceived inability to lose perhaps? it triggered things. Now I feel like I did before my last bad restriction period about my body, so I know it can easily be very dangerous and very quickly.

Part of it is likely also wanting control as I’m stressed out a lot. Upcoming due dates I think played a role.

Further, due to my hormonal cycle (no period though) I often have no appetite for a couple days and more of an appetite or more cravings then usual. I don’t engage in binging or anything but do try to allow myself leniency in the foods I eat during this time. For example, if this is the first time all year I’ve wanted chocolate milk, I’ll let myself have some.

I’m just scared

Part of me is also scared about what if I do get that period of an appetite, except it’s not coming and I don’t think it is. I just lost mostly all of my appetite almost overnight.

I won’t even drink water when I’m thirsty and drink very little.

I’m worried about my doctors appointment, which worsens my behaviours/thoughts/feelings knowing I will get weighed. But I also have an event this week. So as much as I want to fight it I also want to keep going as I always try to be as skinniest as possible for things.

I’m already having physical effects and I really fear the future. I don’t know what to do. I tried buying some things like apples as I saw a cool thing on tiktok but can’t even touch them.

I don’t know what to do. I’m in school so I can’t just “get treatment” and have avoided it in the past even if it meant gaining weight. My disorder however is too bad that anything besides inpatient will not work with me. Yet I have effectively been able to run from inpatient through gaining weight and lying I was doing better a while back (which triggered insane restriction which fucked my heart and digestive system) and avoiding doctors. 

Part of me wants help but I can’t with school and everything else.

Should I wait till after the event maybe? See if that enables me to be able to eat more?

I was thinking also maybe reach out to a friend and say if its bad in a week to encourage help or something but that feels dumb and wrong and immature and attention seeking. I don’t entirely hide things and they know I’ve been struggling the past few days, I just worry about if I slip.

My anxiety is also so bad because money is tight that despite having at least a month of food, I wish to starve myself so over the next couple months when I’m broke I’ll have food.

1021,friend venting ab ed,"tldr; my plus friend kinda triggered me; and now i feel like a dick for having an ed

i probably told my friend i had an eating disorder at one point. i don’t remember directly telling her but i’ve definitely mentioned it. now, she is plus size and i’m not. i’ve never called myself fat in front of her or talked about wanting to lose weight, i’ve only talked ab the self-harm part of it if asked not the weight part (even though she probably knows it’s ab weight). recently i’ve started to relapse, on and off, issues w my dad and school starting and i’m gonna be 20 which is terrifying, but i’m falling back into old patterns. 

now- the story. my friend also has an ed. i sent her a tik tok on the new ice spice drink and how caloric it is and alternatives to the drink and said “let’s split it”. honestly i wasn’t thinking about the calories or anything disordered, just that it’s a lot in a drink and we should split it. she then asked me why i was thinking about weight loss, i said i wasn’t this was just the tik tok that came up on my fyp ab the drink. then she goes into a vent/joke about her ed and how she doesn’t eat and she’s lost xx lbs. i don’t know what to say so i just tell her “don’t do it that hurts” (bc i can’t comfort ppl, i just joke and usually that’s enough for ppl to feel better😭) -fast forward, i’m one my break at work same day and she comes and brings me a medium of the drink. i tell her to try it, and she refuses. we talk more ab calories and im just thinking “if i don’t drink this im a dick but if i do i literally am going to want to kms” so i did, she eventually left and i threw like half of it out. but bc of that conversation i skipped my daily iced coffee, just for her to bring me a drink w way more calories and not even any coffee. now i want to kms. and after work, we hung out and got dinner and i ended up eating more then her because i didn’t want her to feel bad about eating. but now i feel awful, mentally and physically bc why do i hate my body? i think my friend is beautiful, but if she ever knew that i hate my body how would she feel about herself? what if she already knows which she probably does anyway",16lexi5,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16lexi5/friend_venting_ab_ed/,AnorexiaNervosa

1024,I don’t know what to do,I live in Germany. I live with flat mates paid by child support. My caretakers knew I suffer from anorexia. Because I started to recover in the beginning of the year they left me alone with it and let me move in again. 2 months ago I started to fall into my ed again and they could tell by now. They told me I have to try to recover or they’ll put me into psych ward if my weight gets dangerous again. I’m really scared because I was just in clinic in the beginning of the year and I’d have to start the school year again. I rationally know that it would be the right thing to try so I can stay home and go to school because I’m really motivated to go to school. But I really don’t want to recover. I could move to a place paid by social support so no one can stop me. I told my caretaker but she said that it isn’t the solution because if I continue I’m going to be dead in a year.

But I was reading this really good sapphic romance novel and one of the FMC has bulimia and I wasn’t prepared for it to be in the book but I think it just set me back a lot in my recovery. It just hurts so much because in a lot of ways, we were in the same position. It’s soooo hard sometimes to feel worthy of food. That putting much needed calories into my body is something that I am worthy of. It’s so tiring to fight every day when all I see is everyone else not having to deal with it(outwardly anyway). Her partner helps her recover and I wish it were that easy. To just have someone make me say I’m worthy every day and make it feel true. I’m just lost. I’ve started losing again and I’m scared because at least I felt okay where I was at. It wasn’t much but I wasn’t regressing. Now I’m back on that path and I’m not sure how I’m going to stop.

1033,My parents trigger my disorder,"Tw for depression, suicide, and transphobia. I apologize if this seems disjointed. It's also very long. I'm still making sense of my illness, and my past, and I really can't get it all to flow neatly. But, I want to get it out there, because I desperately need advice. And maybe some sympathy for others who have to deal with this awful disorder.

I have anorexia, and I'm a transgender woman. For as long as I can remember, my parents have commented negatively on my body, weight, and eating habits. I remember the first time I starved myself, I was about 5 years old. As a little chubby kid, I felt incredibly ashamed of my body, and through this, I managed to make myself skinny, and retain my thinness my whole life. Thinking about this still causes me a lot of pain.

Even as a kid, I wasn't able to talk about any of my feelings with my parents. If I tried to, or if I lost control of my emotions, it upset them both so much that I had to console them and tell them that I was okay even if I wasn't. The only time that I was allowed to not be okay was when I was sick. I guess I realized this a little later, when I was about 10, and exploited it occasionally by faking sickness when I was too upset or lonely for me alone to handle. I think that this might've been why hunger, and the bodily weakness it caused me, started to make me feel secure. I ate even less throughout puberty, as the bodily changes I was experiencing frightened and disgusted me. Hunger was my recourse. I had always felt like I should've been born a girl, but I also didn't think that I could share this with anyone. To me, ignorant of the existence of  trangender people, it seemed like I was suffering under a delusion, and should do my best to forget about it.

I made it through school okay, with good grades and friends, but toward the end of highschool I became extremely depressed. I started having seizures. I was suicidal. My mind seemed to come and go along with my self-control, and I was unable to keep up my carefully crafted facade around them. My parents then, got meaner and meaner. I thought that they were afraid I would become a failure to thrive adult, and that maybe this scared them because that would mean that they had also failed me. So, I tried to get help. I told them about my depression, and after some months, I convinced them to let me see a therapist. I got on antidepressants, but as soon as I started to feel better, my dad began telling me how emotionless I was. How I was a zombie due to those antidepressants. I resented this, and knew that i was healing, but he kept saying it. It made me sick to my stomach knowing that he felt cut-off from me. So I stopped them after a while.

Years later, I came out to them as transgender. They seemed to accept it at first, which made me happier than I'd felt in a while. It seemed like they were finally going to accept all of me, all of my feelings, and that I was finally going to be able to be myself. But about a week later, I came home late at night from a day of school followed by work to find my dad sitting in the dark in my living room. The tv was off, which I thought was strange. Since he was doing nothing, I guessed he had been waiting for me, sat down beside him, and looked at him. He had this grim look on his face, and was staring straight ahead at nothing. I had a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach, and asked him what was going on. Then, he exploded. Body language was wild, huge, rapid, abrupt gestures, he started yelling at me, telling me that me being transgender was stupid, that someone had to have ""done this to me"", since I didn't show any signs of it. I didn't say anything, just clenched my fists, trying to hold back tears and anger. It culminated in me leaving the house, yelling ""fuck off!"" Or something like that, and leaving. I wasn't welcome back. Stayed with friends until I could afford to move somewhere.

I'm going to skip ahead to today since I think I've given a pretty clear representation of my relationship with my parents.

It's only been a month or two since I started trying to increase my food intake, fix the bad thought patterns, and get better from anorexia. I also tried to cut all contact with my parents. This was successful for a while, however, my parents have been wanting to see me again, and it seems like they'll do anything to make sure I stay in contact with them. Anything except change or look at themselves and our relationship. They said they accept me and my being trans, but they refuse to use my new name or pronouns. I've been on hormones for two years now. They still comment on my body, and eating habits, only now there's some weird tranmisogyny in the mix as well. Whenever they demand to see me, or call me or text me, I want to starve myself. For many reasons, I wish to cut contact with them, but they will not accept this. I feel scared and alone and hurt. My body is weak, (i just lost my manual labor job due to this), my seizures came back, and my mind is going once again. I just can't figure out what to do.",16ke702,9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16ke702/my_parents_trigger_my_disorder/,AnorexiaNervosa

I feel like like my thought process is disordered b I also feel like a wanna berexic T . T ill initiative fasts and maybe follow through for 2 days and give up while other “real” anorexics will fast for days. 

I don’t even want to be anorexic b I can just find out if I’m disordered I’ll be actually able to deal with the issue more efficiently bc right now I’ve been sort of gaslighting myself into “liking food” and eating more in the sake of “not being disordered”

I gained like what 10 lbs in 2 weeks or so not even two weeks it literally just came on overnight and is not going so I don’t know what’s up…. And I will literally be on the verge of tears over weight gain and wanna starve and just spiral basically. I’m not sure if that’s a normal response or not though. 

I have spaces and time periods where I won’t eat and when I was like 7 I told my mom I didn’t want to eat bc I wanted to be skinny like the models.. I’ve always been skinnier but I’ve never been the one to splurge or binge on food usually. The only reason I gained so much weight is because college has so many options and I think I went over board as in i basically fucking binged. And I’m so 😭 I’m so upset with myself. 

I don’t know if it’s non disordered and I’m just holding myself accountable or the anger is coming from being disordered but I don’t wanna eat anymore and I’m honestly probably going to do a week fast or sowmthing or just try to regulate my eating. AHHH I don’t know but I genuinely want to die rn. 

I used to workout after every meal in the summer time and I used to get into ketosis like daily naturally. But yeah now I feel like disgusting this is genuinely the highest weight I’ve ever been 😭 even though it’s healthy weight I’m 5’6 and 135 I’ve always just had a desire to be underweight @ bmi 18 or bmi 15 at the lowest. My goal is to be 110 lbs honestly or 85 at the lowest. But I feel like I have these goals but I don’t actively pursue them like diagnosed anorexics so.

I hate the feeling of being full, I wish I could never eat if I didn’t have to and I wish I could genuinely photosynthesize. I’m really scared bc I know is easier to gain weight than it is to lose it and I don’t wanna hold on to this 10lbs forever😔 I’d prefer to be disordered so I can find a way to go around fixing this than just be someone who wants to be skinny but I have no clue what traits I exhibit.",16jxfpo,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16jxfpo/am_i_even_disordered/,AnorexiaNervosa

Important context: I’ve been bouncing between BED and Anorexia for most of my life. I’m currently in partial recovery from both thankfully as I’m neither binging or restricting for the first time in like half a decade. I’m 16, and overweight. I am transgender, ftm but still at an all girls school

I’ve recently started my Alevels and since i went to an all girls school for secondary and my Anorexia wasn’t too bad for a while after I transitioned because there were very few goal weight men in my life. 

Now the sixth form is opened up to boys, and I’ve now got at least one boy who looks how i want to look in every class, friendship group, everything. Because of this, I’ve started doing fasting periods. 

But recently (like today) a new student called me fat, to my face, and told me to start exercising. This made me feel terrible and I’m really struggling to continue with recovery. I normally cope with these feelings with triple digit limits and ridiculous fasting periods with over exercise. 

I’m physically disabled, and i can’t do my restrictions and manage my health/school concerns. I know myself and know if I start I will spiral and won’t be able to stop, but I also cannot stop myself, cause being in school is just so triggering rn.

I had coffee with dairy and some sugars, though anything else that follows is firmly now branded a binge in my sickened mind I suppose? A snack of cucumber or tomato feels like a lie calorie-wise, especially if I’m breaking a fast, slim chance they’re as calorie friendly as the numbers claim they are, must be false information? Surely when you add the salt and pepper on top, that is when it becomes a meal. Now, the single meal a day I so graciously *grant* and fantasize over all day long feels enamoured in shame and anger as well? What’s worse is that one meal today was a very standard size of soup and diet cola. Immediately back on the scale, disgraced at the effect of sodium, though I’m still starving, disgusting. How did it happen like this? How did I become within this thinking? Why is this serpent so tightly constricted around my soul? No one in their right mental should *ever* feel the amount of pure loathing and fear I currently am over eating a can of soup and drinking a cup of coffee within a full day, it’s bizarre, when I type it… But not one lullaby of soothe I sing to my psyche can convince myself that my soup wasn’t a full blown binge. Am I losing the plot? Did I binge? I’m so sorry if I sound like a lost and paranoid filled fool, just frozen with fear over what progress I lost.

Im unsure of what I’m losing within myself.",16j4qhq,8,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16j4qhq/soup_as_a_meal_is_not_a_binge_soup_as_a_meal_is/,AnorexiaNervosa

No matter what nothing is getting better because I’m constantly beating myself up. Even if I’m just under maintenance I freak out and get so mad at myself that I can’t get myself to eat a little bit more. I feel like it’s the end of the world if I go a little over or a little under.it’s taking up so much mental space because it’s not even possible to eat the exact amount everyday. Especially because at work for lunch I estimate calories. Idk what to do or how to get out of this mindset because I do feel better and happier eating at maintenance but my perfectionist tendencies and compulsive behaviors are actually worse then when I restrict. When I restrict I feel calm and my thoughts are at ease. When I need to eat at maintenance I’m constantly worried if I’m over but then I worry if I’m under and nothing feels right and it’s so much worse.

1051,Using my ed as an excuse for every mistake,"One reason why I don't want to give up my eating disorder right now is that I can use it as a cause for mistakes or stupid situations in everyday life. 

Did I fail an exam? This is due to my eating disorder (because illness and so on). 

Am I not getting something right? (had no energy for it because of the eating disorder).

 I always use it as an excuse for myself because I am mentally ill and I am strongly influenced by it. 

Sometimes more sometimes less. 

But basically, the eating disorder is a reason for every mistake in my life for now (even though my own stupidity or normal weaknesses might be the reason), so that I don't blame myself. 

There may be a little egoism there, but this mindset makes it easier for me to put up with stupid situations.

It's like escaping from unpleasant situations so that I realize ""Oh, it's all the eating disorder"" and it's not my fault. 

At the same time, I don't seek help and I can't admit guilt to myself.",16iu6ux,26,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16iu6ux/using_my_ed_as_an_excuse_for_every_mistake/,AnorexiaNervosa

I never get that ""hungry"" feeling anymore.. it's been going on for a long time. I can easily go about my days without even thinking about food, and simply not caring. I've lost hair soo many times and have had to wear wigs.. I don't even want to get help. I like being like this, if I was forced to get help, I'd flip! I have ADHD and my psychiatrist REFUSES to give me medicine for it, in fear that I'll lose weight. My weight fluctuates from really thin, to thin/healthy. Right now I'm thin/healthy.. and he refuses. I never told him I had an ED either! I struggle with it a lot when i'm on the healthy looking side, and have a constant fear of getting bigger, I love the feeling that I get when I'm skinny, like I can take over the world. I constantly body check and I have TONS of pics in my phone of me standing in the same place and same position so I can compare them side to side to check my weight, because the scale is my enemy.. I refuse to go on it.. I only have it because my fiance uses it. Does anyone else feel this way? Like you're at peace with how you handle your ED and see no need to ever want to get help?

1059,"I can’t go back into recovery, i’m genuinely sick of looking at myself","I think I need to hear feedback on this because i’m too scared to tell anyone in my life right now. i am aware i have Anorexia Nervosa, I just don’t think it’s making me “sick” or has to be a horrible thing. I went to treatment in and out for a couple of years now and recently finished my treatment program. To be completely honest, I knew i was gonna try to lose weight when i left. I did everything i could to appear better and be able to leave and especially make things better with my family as they were very upset at how “bad” things got. The thing though is that I don’t necessarily think having anorexia is a bad thing. I’ve been told it’s like a super power to be able to drop weight and not miss food. I miss being able to eat whatever I want and not fear gaining weight from it since I was already at my lowest weight. Every time I’ve looked in a mirror being in recovery I genuinely don’t recognize myself and hate the way I look. I can’t talk to anyone close to me about this because they’ll try to convince me I don’t need to lose weight to be “good”. Bottom line is i don’t think being anorexic is a bad thing if i can avoid going overboard with it. I don’t plan on losing everything i gained, just enough to where I don’t hate looking at myself. I’ve already lost a fair amount of weight and my family keeps trying to pressure me to weigh me and I don’t want to go back. I genuinely am at a place where I cannot stand looking at myself and I simply can’t go back somewhere where i got extremely big. I’ve been thin my entire life and it’s normal for me but these people brainwashed my entire family into thinking if i lose a couple of pounds I need treatment again.  I don’t really know what to do. I feel kind of desperate typing this out as i have no where to go for support because everyone is gonna tell me lies and say “im beautiful the way i am” which is honestly the worst part.

1065,help with my friend,"Okay so my friend has had an eating disorder since she was a sophomore in high school and she is now a senior in college. She has had other health scares in the past with it such as a heart murmur. She has done out patient twice and in patient once to help solve it.
Nothing has clearly worked. Her weight fluctuates a lot given a few months difference. She is a heavy drinker (college student at #1 party school) and does coke. (she has recently became addicted to it over the summer even tho she has lost no weight from it) she throws up often when we are out, but you can never tell if it's from drinking or her ED. She has bulimia and anorexia. Usually you can tell when her ED is bad because she'll become very skinny but this time was a surprise. She doesn't listen to anyone and there's nothing we can really do. At this point, we all know she has one, but we just push it under the water. Recently over the weekend she went to the hospital because she was throwing up what looked like coffee grounds. She has a tear in her esophagus. She says she is stopping but I know she isn't. We go to different colleges and we try to talk to her about it and she has barely answered since Saturday. She left our gc (to be dramatic) and is clearly not getting help. She doesn't realize how serious this is AND HASNT TOLD HER PARENTS. What do you think I should do? I know her parents, but they are very odd people. I know they have the funds to send her to a treatment center, but I just don't know the best approach. The doctors literally told her she will die if she doesn't stop. Should I text her mom?

1074,Struggling so much with recovery. How do I stop feeling like this is permanent?,"I know recovery’s never linear but I just don’t get it, it’s never been this bad before. I’ve dealt with EDs since I was a teenager and recently had the absolute most atrocious relapse into anorexia I’ve ever had. I began focusing on recovery near the end of June when I started having health issues; I’ve been putting in the work, genuinely trying so hard, but it’s just not sticking. The thought of food/calories/weight gain is essentially a fixture of my brain now, I can’t walk a single step or even think about eating without involuntarily tracking the calories burnt/eaten. I can’t stress enough how much I hate my ED and how badly I want to recover, there’s nothing glamorous about this for me. For the past 4 months, I’ve either been painfully hungry or fighting the anxiety/guilt of having eaten. Constantly. I don’t remember the last time I stood up without my vision going black, I’m cold all the time, I can’t sleep, I can’t focus. I haven’t had my period since July, my hair’s falling out, my teeth hurt, I had horrible bruising all over my legs and ankles up until a few weeks ago. I’m just exhausted. It affected me to the point of spending a whole month shut in after I finished undergrad because I could only get myself to eat every other day and my friends usually like to eat together when we hang out. I WANT to recover, so why can’t I?

It’s been so demoralizing and I’m worried I hit a breaking point yesterday. I had to get my body measured for something, which is bad enough in and of itself, and one of my friends made a joke about me freaking out if I was a single centimeter off from “ideal.” Followed by another joke about how if that happened, I’d probably blame it on this one thing I’d eaten that weekend. It hurt a bit since I actually got myself to eat full meals that weekend and I was rlly proud of that. What sucks is that he wasn’t trying to be hurtful, he actually wouldn’t have said it if he knew it would hit a nerve. This was his genuine commentary on the way I’m perceived. I’ve made my mental illness such an integral part of me that it’s now normalized and seen as just a character trait. It made me realize all my recovery efforts from the last few months were just so insufficient, I’m still sick, I’m still so visibly and noticeably sick people can make jokes about it without it raising any red flags/being seen as unusual behaviors

I’m genuinely at a loss here, trying to stop feeling like I hit a point of no return and just can’t recover anymore. Is it possible that my brain and body are just permanently altered or something? I’m actively concerned about my health issues but my brain just won’t let me recover.

TW 


So I m 19F almost 20 and I’ve definitely had a range of Eds since I was 15. The primary one is anorexia and I’m in the worst “relapse” i quote it because I don’t feel I ever recovered mentally, just physically. This consciously started a lil over a month ago after a breakup triggered me to get bad again. 
For the first time I’m being 100% honestly with loved ones and professionals about what’s going on in my mind now that im an adult i just don’t feel the need to be so secret since I can’t be forced into treatment.
But now I have urgently been referred by my therapist (who doesn’t specialize in Ed’s) to different therapists and programs for assessments, due to concerns we both have about my very low heart rate. I’ve also had such rapid weight loss.


So I got an assessment from ERC today and they suggest PHP. Im too scared to do it and I’ve heard awful things about the place itself, plus it’s way too expensive.
Idk what to do because I don’t want this to kill me but I won’t let myself or my family pay thousands of dollars just to make me physically recover again.
Idk if im being stubborn but this is where im at and idk what to do, I’ve never rlly wanted to recover like this

also realised this is really long so just really the bottom part is most important i think?


anyways i’ve suffered with my eating for years i want to say maybe 6 years on and off? maybe more? i was on a medication that took my hunger away (i didn’t take it for that reason) and i also had extreme emtaphobia (fear of throwing up) it got to a point i couldn’t eat foods unless i knew they couldn’t make me sick, and i wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between hunger and sickness. i would go ages without eating a lot, because i was terrified i’d be sick, i literally would beg my mom to help me and have extreme anxiety attacks when i felt slightly sick (i’d be in tears begging her to help and make it stop) 

so i lost a lot of weight and i was so hungry or malnourished? that i would stand up and couldn’t move because id be in extreme pain in my stomach. that kinda fixed itself or got better my phobia, but time went on the over covid i gained weight and i started to really be insecure about my body. i also did high intensity sport everyday, then my coach put me on a meal plan i won’t go into detail about it. that really messed me up especially when he told me my BMI. fast forward i would do all normal or thought to be normal anorexic things (counting cals, not eating etc) and saw some results. also started self harm so not fun

anyways i was better last year. if anything i went the opposite i couldn’t stop eating, but this year (also i went full time vegan end of 2021) i had 3 deaths in a short period of time and i started liking the control i got from it. i wasn’t doing it for how i looked i’m doing it for how it makes me feel, and how i don’t feel the grief. i also am very much a perfectionist, but i feel so bad saying i have an ed, yet i also sort of crave the validation to know i’m not just an attention seeker? i don’t think people have noticed because i do eat and i can eat a lot sometimes, i also have not lost a significant amount of weight. i want the validation to say yes you do struggle with this and your not being dramatic, but then i don’t want to change because i like the control?

i’m looking for advice or views. i’m not trying to trauma dump or whatever, i just want peoples opinions on this as i feel so invalid for saying i have an ed. i want someone to notice but then i don’t want help? it sounds so bad",16gh5ur,3,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16gh5ur/can_i_still_say_i_have_anorexia_even_if_i_dont/,AnorexiaNervosa

1090,Doctor isn’t worried about me - feeling invalidated,"I saw a doctor for the first time since I lost a lot of weight. It wasn’t ED related, my lower back has been hurting for a few weeks and I wanted to make sure it wasn’t something kidney related or if I could maybe get a stronger painkiller. 

But without saying numbers, I have gone from just at the cusp of normal and underweight BMI (which I had been maintaining for like ten years) to several BMI points lower since I last saw a doctor in May. I was expecting the doctor to bring that up but she didn’t. I was mostly hoping she wouldn’t because I don’t want recover and I can’t talk about it without crying, but now that she didn’t say a word I feel like I have to get sicker :/ Like I’m barely eating anything and I’m suffering so much and it’s not enough for a doctor to be worried?? To be fair, she barely talked to me at all and told me to just wait for it to heal on its own. So maybe she wasn’t the most attentive doctor. 

I do have a nutritionist and a therapist who are worried about me and were asking me to see a doctor. But I’ve been hesitant because 1. I don’t intend to cooperate and get better and 2. I don’t really think I’m physically sick enough for anyone to take me seriously. And now I know. 

Side note, has anyone else ever experienced lower back pain because of anorexia?

1107,I’m desperate for advice/support…,"I’m not sick enough to get inpatient treatment, according to the BMI and the numbers on the scales. I’m not honest with my therapists about how badly I’m doing, because they all look at my “normal weight” and concludes that I’m doing good. They believe I’m in recovery/am recovered. Which is so far from the truth. I know for a fact that if I was to be honest with them, about my severely restrictive eating, they would kick me out of their outpatient clinic and I would be transferred to an outpatient clinic for people with EDS. Which probably wouldn’t be too bad. Especially if one takes into consideration that my therapists aren’t specialized in EDS at all. But I don’t see how different therapists should be able to help me outpatient, even if they are specialized in EDS. They would also just let the numbers on the scales dictate wether or not I need outpatient or inpatient treatment. And they would then most likely decided that it’s perfectly fine for me to continue with outpatient therapy. But I don’t agree with that at all. I don’t want to gain weight, because I’m most likely still at a normal weight (it’s been quite some time since I last got weighed at the outpatient clinic). However, my eating is completely and extremely out of my control. I don’t have any set meals, and for the first time ever, (possible TW) I’ve gone a day or two without eating. I’m very depressed and can’t cope. I want to eat, yet at the same time I’m terrified of food and eating. I’m seeing a counselor who struggled a lot with EDS AN herself, and who considers herself recovered. She told me how she is seriously worried for me and my health, and that inpatient treatment is the best and only option of treatment if I want to get better. She knows I can’t do this on my own. I can’t eat on my own. She wants me to be honest with my current therapists. But it’s just so hard. Last time I were honest in regards to my eating habits, they got really mad and upset with me. They told me that eating enough calories during the day is very easy, and how there’s no excuse for not doing exactly as I’m being told (eating the amount of food they want me to eat).

1113,Help,"My ED has been spiraling due to a lot of emotional distress.

Something I realized is that I think I am addicted to diet pills. No matter what my therapist say, I somehow refuse to put it down, as much as my refusal to eat. I haven't told my psychiatrist yet, but I'm currently on three medications for depression at the highest dose.
I'm not sure if I'm bulimic or teetering towards anorexia since self-diagnosis is awkward to me, but I body check every so often almost daily, suppress my urges to eat, feeling sickly after eating, no appetite some days, binge and purge from time to time.

I am well aware of my condition and I want to get better for myself and for the people around me.

So question,  is there anyway I can make small, progressive steps on how I can overcome this hurdle? What do you do?",16dueo8,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16dueo8/help/,AnorexiaNervosa

1116,Worried I'm developing unhealthy habits,"Recently I've been trying to get back in shape, which for me means gaining muscle however I keep getting caught up in that basic rule of burning more calories than I take in. I started running again but quickly realised that id need to adjust my diet to see a significant difference.

I started by just eating healthier foods but I can only make what's accessable to me and of course there were days where there were only less healthy foods left. If my meals were going to be more calorie packed I should just eat less right? But it kept escalating, I started bringing a lunch to school which I'd never consistently done before, but I always felt guilty about whatever I ate and it would end up being the only thing I ate that day. 

I wouldn't have much energy but I'd always go for my runs at the end of the day, there were a few times I collapsed from pure hunger but when I got home and saw the food in my kitchen I felt disgusted at the thought of being so weak and giving in to the temptation, so wouldn't let myself

Then something changed, All of a sudden mid fall temperatures are up to 30°C after 2 straight months of rain. So throughout the days, I wore lighter clothes, clothes that showed more of my body. Everyday I would get back from my run and look at myself in the full length mirror that covers an entire wall in my bedroom and everyday I would focus in on one part, my ribs.

For the first time in my life I could see my ribs and it made me happy, but the next day I would eat and they would dispear again, so I stopped eating. It stoped being about the little bit of fat on my thighs turning to muscle and it became about how much of my ribcage I could see.  

My dilemma. I work a physical job on the weekends and I can't be weak and lethargic, I need energy, but I love seeing more and more of my ribcage in the mirror and I don't want to give that up. I wanna see how far I can take this but I don't know if it's sustainable. I doubt anyone will notice either way but I'm conflicted, any advice?",16dradp,7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16dradp/worried_im_developing_unhealthy_habits/,AnorexiaNervosa

This past year so far i’ve been sick 21 times and counting. It’s so bad my coworkers think i’m slacking because i always need to take sick days.

In august I was sick 3 times with 1 cold after another. I go from sore throat -> fever -> healing/cough -> sore throat again while coughing phlegm (new cold). I essentially have 2 colds at a time now.

I’m so tired of getting a sore throat, fever and the whole thing. I was wondering if anyone else suffers low immunity now that they’re recovered and started recovering?

1127,I feel so ashamed of my body,"TW

I lost so much weight in the last few months and I look like a completely different person. I never had a big chest or butt, but at least I had a little. Enough, I‘d say. Now I don’t. I am completely flat. Like, absolutely flat. I have nothing left. And when I say nothing, I mean it. I‘d almost say it looks ”funny“. Not to me, but to others. I notice people staring, some are chuckling. I don’t know for sure if it’s because of me or if they are laughing about something else, but I have this weird feeling it’s about me. The stares are directed at me though. I feel so child-like and the irony with this is that this feeling was always my goal while suffering from anorexia. Now that I basically have the body of a child, besides the fact that I am very, very tall, I feel so ugly. My butt is as flat as a wall (not kidding), and I have zero boobs left. Oh my god, I cannot even begin to describe how ashamed I feel. Everywhere I see these beautiful women with their curves and healthy face and body and I can’t help but feel disgusting. I know my boyfriend loves me the way I am, he always reminds me of that, but I am so scared he doesn’t feel attracted to me anymore. He told me he still is, and that that‘ll never change, but he’s worried nonetheless. Does anyone feel the same way? Now that I have my ”dream body“, I am more unsatisfied with it than ever before. I am not a woman anymore. Not saying women with my body type aren’t, I’m just not. Not anymore. And it’s hard not to cry every time I’m out and see all these stunning women while I’m sitting here feeling disgusted with the body I always wanted to have. I didn’t just lose weight, I lost everything. My smile, my personality, my happiness and ultimately myself. For what? I still feel fat, even though I deep down know how I look. Sometimes I see it and I don’t recognize myself anymore. Everyone’s shocked when they look at me, strangers literally talk to me on the street about my body (don’t know where they got the audacity from), stare and shake their head and yesterday, a homeless shouted after me that ”Oh wow!“ I ”look as emaciated as him“. I bawled my eyes out in my car after that. A few years ago I would‘ve felt weirdly proud, now I’m just so ashamed. I’m convinced that especially men are making fun of my body. I’m suffering immensely and somehow it’s funny to others.  Am I alone in this or can anyone relate?

In self decided recovery that voice is quiet, but as I start feeling ""strange"" about my body again, it's there. Asking me why I coated my legs with fat once again.

There's no way out of this. Even if I recover, the ugly thoughts about food and my body will still remain somewhere in my mind. I can never eat chips while actually enjoying it.
but yeah sorry for the english. I think this is it. I'm here again and I don't think recovery will ever work for me.
It's my first year of high school (Im 15) and a part of me says I should just stop and eat bc this year is going to be hard, while the other part says it'll be much easier to restrict at school and yeah. this monday school opens.

I’m trying to recover only for health reasons, as bad as it does sound I deep down don’t want to recover and feel better when I starve. I literally do not know why I feel better when I do and I’m weirded out by the fact I feel good about myself when I starve. I’ve really been trying but recovery is so hard. At first I’m hopeful and optimistic but then when the weight starts gaining I feel horrible. Weight only goes to my stomach and no where else and I do not have a fast metabolism at all. I have a bad habit of body checking every moment of the day, I’ve been able to stop checking the scale, I used to 6-7 times a day alone, but trying to stop body check is hard. And then people’s comment online hurt a lot too. I’ve seen stuff like “at least I don’t cry when I eat” “you’ve gone stupid from starving” as insults and it hurts a lot even though the comment was directed to some anorexic person being rude and mean. I don’t agree with what that anorexic person said at all, but the comment they received hurts me so bad. Those comments kept replaying in my head over and over all today and my eyes hurt from crying. It’s hard to ignore comments like that and I can’t even if I tried. I once saw a a bunch of people in a comment section making fun of an anorexic person and going off about how she’s so dumb and lost braincells from starving. Today i under ate a lot, it’s no where enough for a person my age and height to eat. I feel guilty for starving but at the same time I’m feeling guilty for eating.

in another unit i was in, there were other patients who had anorexia. i dont want to sound like a narcissistic asshole when i say this, but i wish the staff cared about me and my ed nearly as much as they cared about theirs. they gave 0 fucks about my eating disorder and i feel like if they cared, even just a tiny bit, i wouldnt have left there feeling like no one gives a shit and i can just go back to my eating habits without anyone batting an eye. i understand that they were more severe cases, i really do, and i was “recovering” so they didnt have to do anything, but cmon. they would do weigh ins and notice i was losing weight and did nothing. im not trying to blame anyone for my relapse but i just feel so alone. my mum enables me, and just when things are starting to get worse again im discharged from all services. im constantly in a war with my head, and no one seems to care.

as she was talking i told her how a part of me imagined give up/throwing out my scale, eating all of the foods, doing all the things and how i don’t fucking know how to make it click. i know i can’t change the fact that my parents are incapable of giving me the support with meals that i need. i know my ed will never feel sick enough, my ed will never feel ready to let go. i know what’s on the line if i don’t turn it around, and i know that all i’m doing is pushing off the things and people i love. yet the only reason i’m still doing treatment is because of my boyfriend. i’m so incredibly exhausted. i want to give up, both my ed (in theory) and in living. i even went to take my scale out of the bathroom so it’s in a less convenient spot, and all i could do was touch it. i know logically that this weight is not healthy but it’s so hard to convince myself of that when my body is functioning so much better than when i was at my LW. if anyone could give me any glimmer of hope/advice or even just a response i’d really appreciate it because i’m running out of steam",16bzygt,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16bzygt/how_do_i_make_it_click/,AnorexiaNervosa

1155,Scared of getting help,"Hello everyone, my name is Daniel and I'm 21 years old.
I struggled with anorexia for two years, from 2018 - 2020.
After I met my current boyfriend I started recovering (all on my own, never seeked professional help). 
So from 2021 my boyfriend and me went to the gym, started weightlifting and I started to gain a significant amount of weight/muscles.
But I also started with tracking my cal intake, so I make sure I gain weight/muscles. 
Fast forward, this year in April, I started my diet to lose some body fat and that's where it all started again.
I got really obsessed with making sure I walk enough steps a day, never overeat my cal, so I started with the same old behaviors as my old anorexic self. 
Now in September, I lost a significant amount of weight, I'm nearly at the weight again where I first meet my boyfriend.

He also noticed that I lost some weight.
I keep telling myself that If lose just some more kilograms  than I will stop and start maintaining.

I at the lowest of the normal weight (bmi wise).
So I don't really think Im sick enough to deserve some help.
But my relationship with food is so fcked up. 
I don't know what to do, I just feel depressed since months and I don't know where I should start to get help..... what if the doctors don't see any problem???

1162,confused,"Why are so many eating disorder treatment centers HAES aligned?

why is the ideal weight based on growth charts? i read the explanation on the feast-ed.org site and it doesn’t make any sense to me? “Many clinics now use lifetime height and weight charts to determine where a patient would have been had the illness not altered growth… It is possible for a person to have a “normal” or high BMI but still be significantly underweight for his or her own frame and physiology.” how does this logic only apply to people with normal/overweight BMI and not an underweight one? what if you had poor eating habits ie one that was mainly made up of junk food instead of whole food? it kinda just seems like the set point theory to me WHICH IS A THEORY. for me personally i weighed the most i ever did in middle school bc of my poor eating habits like i would mainly just eat chips, cookies, etc. how is that healthy? i started to lose weight as i started to incorporate more whole foods into my diet over the years (not intentionally trying to lose weight although it wouldn’t have been an issue since i was nearly overweight anyway). in college, i developed an ED and became extremely underweight which was years after i had unintentionally lost the previous weight. **I do think it’s important to mention that i’ve gained some weight and i’m back to the healthy bmi range. ** now i’m being told i need to weigh as much as i did in middle school and that it’s the ideal weight to me, which has me extremely confused? i understand wanting me to be within the healthy BMI range but why is there so much fixation on setting my ideal weight based on “growth charts” which are literally just dependent on the person’s eating habits anyway. it doesn’t take into account how the person was eating prior to the ED.

1163,Imposter syndrome,"I’ve always felt like my struggles were never bad enough to label as an eating disorder or to deserve help. I don’t feel comfortable talking about my weight, but I will say I’ve never been hospitalized and I don’t think my health has been in serious danger. 

Still, my disordered eating has impacted my life so heavily, for as long as I’ve been conscious. I’ve never had a healthy relationship with my body and food, for so many reasons mostly trauma related. 

The best way I can describe this feeling is imposter syndrome. When I consider the idea of people knowing I have an eating disorder, it makes me cringe and want to disappear. It feels like I don’t deserve it, if that at all makes sense. I don’t deserve help, I don’t deserve concern, and I certainly don’t deserve to claim the title of eating disorder without a diagnosis and while others are struggling so much more severely. 

My ED is manageable in the sense that I can live, but my compulsions around food have made it so that I can’t eat without being completely comfortable. I can’t eat much around friends, I can’t do anything food related without my anxiety medication if I haven’t done my rituals.  

I need help. And I can’t ask for it, because even saying the word makes me feel so vulnerable and afraid. 

But I’m admitting it here. I need help, I don’t know where to start.",16b20dr,7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16b20dr/imposter_syndrome/,AnorexiaNervosa

1167,How to Get Help for Your Parent with Anorexia,"Note: I apologize in advance for the novel. I’m also planning to cross-post this on a couple of other threads. 

I am a mid-thirties adult. My mom is 71. She has always been very thin and self-critical about her weight. I and my siblings heard comments all the time growing up (often critical of herself, terribly critical of heavy-set strangers, even critical of close friends who put on a few pounds, though never to their faces). Even though she never ate much, she seemed to be maintaining enough weight that she was not actually physically unhealthy. 

However, she just visited my family for a week. She is exceedingly thin. Thinner than I have ever seen her. She also made frequent comments about food. “Oh, I am not hungry.” “This is so much food!” “I really shouldn’t eat this.” “Didn’t we just eat breakfast?” “I always eat so much when I visit you.” And on and on. She ate alarmingly little. I myself am on the light side of normal weight-wise. I was not forcefeeding her donuts. We eat well-rounded, balanced meals. 

I am not sure how to get her help. She has a primary care physician who she sees for a check up once a year, various specialists she sees occasionally, and a psychiatrist she sees every couple of months. She has bipolar disorder and it is well controlled. She also has anxiety and it is medicated but seems less well controlled. She lives alone. 

Do I try to speak to her psychiatrist first or her general practitioner? Can they even speak to me legally? I didn’t bring it up with her during this visit because I didn’t want to be shut out—she is more than capable of just closing off that topic of conversation and self-censoring so that I can’t tell where her mind is on food and eating. 

I am very worried about her. Any advice is helpful. Thank you in advance.",16au9qn,15,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/16au9qn/how_to_get_help_for_your_parent_with_anorexia/,AnorexiaNervosa

1183,How am I supposed to recover when it makes me so suicidal?,"Basically, my last recovery attempt was awful, from the moment I let go of my food rules I started eating everything I could lay my eyes on

It quickly because clear its extreme hunger, I did what every girlie on here says and didn't fight it

Well guess what, after 12 days of that I weighed more than I did 3 months ago

This in turn made me depressed as fuck and almost kill myself, I only got better when I gave up on recovery 

... but now I want to try again, but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to possibly do this, it'll be the same fucking story again, I don't think giving in is working, it makes me severely depressed, surely honouring extreme hunger isn't the only way?

1191,Recently Diagnosed….encouragement?,"I’ve had signs leading up to that I possibly had an ED. It didn’t rear it’s ugly head until Thursday night when two of my medical professionals were in contact and agreed that I have restrictive and purge. I severely calorie count and push my body hard. 

I met with one of the doctors the first night and the second the next day. I have body dysmorphia and generally just hate myself. I did the weight loss programs, I have been named called regarding my weight, my future in laws point out that I don’t eat (all have literal anxiety when it comes to eating). 

And preparing for a wedding where I don’t want to look like this….makes it harder in general. I thought in my mind I was doing the right thing (I also don’t have an appetite in general—never really have).

Both medical professionals have told me to start at different places of what would help. However, I have food allergies/can’t bring certain foods to work areas because of allergies or my fear of my food becoming contaminated when arriving at the destination. There are other factors but I dont want to go into detail about it.  I don’t need safe foods—that’s something for me to figure out. 

What I really could use is encouragement. Even if it’s a “I believe in you.” I am scared. I feel like a failure….in every aspect and it’s hard telling myself I’m not.

1193,My dad makes me feel invalid,"Possible TW: 

I’m extremely angry and upset with my dad. I told him just a couple of minutes ago, that I’m fed up with getting weighed by my therapist at almost a weekly basis (she’s not specialized in EDs btw). He told me that she needs to weigh me, in order for her to be certain that I’m “healthy”. I then told him that I understand why she needs to make sure I’m at a healthy weight, so that they’re able to provide me with help in regards to my other mental illnesses. But I also told him that I’m extremely unwell with my ED right now, even though I’m considered being at a “healthy weight”. He then proceeded to say how it would be a lot more ill, both physically and mentally, if I were underweight. And that I would’ve been critically ill, had my weight been below “the average”. I told him that I disagreed, since a person within the “healthy weight range” can be just as severely malnourished as an underweight person. Once again he disagreed with me. I tried to hide from him how upset his statements made me feel, but it was really difficult not to tear up or yelling at him. Not that I would’ve dared to yell at him anyways. But I really wanted to. If he had been at my appartement on an ordinary day, and seen with his own eyes how f***** up my eating is, he would’ve been seriously worried for my life. He knows that I’m already starting to get, what my GP refers to as serious, deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. Yet, he believes I would’ve been a lot more ill if I was underweight. He’s wrong. At least, when it comes to my situation, he’s wrong. I’m at my lowest point now in regards to my AN, even more so than when I was diagnosed with AN two years ago, and were at a very low weight. I’m so frustrated and upset, I feel like I can’t cope. He told me that he has a great knowledge about EDs and AN, and that he understand what he’s talking about. He believes his opinion, in regards to my health, is right and my opinion is wrong.

1197,Stumbled into another relapse…,"The last four years I have been in and out of treatment centers for my anorexia. 2019 I rushed through the process because I had to go back to work and also found out while I was in treatment that the friend I was living with was wanting me to move out. So when I transferred my care to my city, I had to deal with treatment 12 hours a day, then find time to completely move my stuff out and into a storage unit because I had nowhere else to go yet. Then I had to go back to work in august and juggle treatment three days a week for three hours after I went to work. The person I ended up staying with didn’t work out for me so I had to find yet another place to live and I was only there for a month or two before I found a room I could rent. I was so stressed out and kind of ambivalent about recovery because my way of coping worked so much better for me. Of course by the time January 2020 came around I was sicker than before and forced by my employer to go back into treatment. That time I tried harder though it was a rocky start. I finished the middle of July and started a new job and then had to find yet a new place to live. But I was okay for a while. 2022 I relapsed again quite severely. Ended up back in treatment and was doing okay even though things were stressful at work. Then I was laid off from my job in February this year. Stressor #1. Tried to find a job not having any luck until I went back to the company I was laid off from to ask for an entry level position knowing I would be taking a pay cut. Then major stressor #2. My background check came back with charges on it from 2020 that I had no idea existed. Long story short- I took an OD of my own medication and went to the er and then to a psych hospital in the beginning of my treatment of 2020. Fought to get back in treatment and worked my ass off to get better. Upon finding out that I had warrants out for my arrest, I consulted with multiple people who advised me to go and turn myself in. So I did that. I had to pay for a bailbond since I don’t have that kind of money. And I now have attorney fees to cover in hopes that he’ll be able to help me get the charges lessened or dismissed… as I clearly wasn’t in a good mental state when the offense occurred. Stressor #3 I have no control over the situation and basically in limbo. My court date is still a couple weeks away and I am uncertain of how it will go. I am in limbo with the job because though I took care of the warrants they want to wait for the outcome of the court date before taking any further steps. And I still can’t find any other jobs. I’ve been getting more and more depressed and my psychiatric treatment has been lacking as I don’t have the resources to go consistently right now. I’ve been rationing my medications. And I began restricting more since I found all this out. The last 6 weeks I have decompensated drastically and I feel the physical/physiological effects of it on my body. But I can’t pull myself out. I’m afraid I am on my way into another relapse that I might not make it out of.",168omzf,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/168omzf/stumbled_into_another_relapse/,AnorexiaNervosa

1211,Does it ever get easier?,"I (23F) have been trying to recover from AN-R for a little less than a month. It’s been really, really hard. Some days are better than others, but today was just the worst. I woke up wanting to restrict and made it halfway through the day before I wanted a snack — after that, my hunger cues were all over the place. That was bad enough. But when I got on the phone later to chat with my partner, they were talking excitedly about food and recipes and because they don’t know how I’ve been struggling, I just listened along and felt nauseous in silence.

Finally, this evening, I went a little crazy with dessert. The sugar crash completely depleted me and now I’m laying on my bed feeling worse than ever.

I know recovery is hard. I also know it’s not linear. But since I started, my mental health has been at its absolute lowest. I’m doing absolutely everything I can to compensate: I have hobbies, I spend time with friends, I try to find recipes I’m excited about, I get sun and plenty of water. But nothing is helping. I am utterly consumed with thoughts of my next meal. I have nightmares about calories and gaining weight. I suffer constant ugly, mean intrusive thoughts about myself and everyone I see.

I’m really really really trying to have a positive outlook. I’m just exhausted. I hate food and I’m so tired of eating.

1218,i relapsed recently and i can tell this time is different,i have like an ed pattern and i relapse pretty bad whenever i start school and about a month before. i never actually recover but i start to eat a little more but still way less than i should. this time though is way worse. i can’t eat almost at all without getting sick and i’ve lost most of my hunger signals. before i was focused on not eating and making sure i wouldn’t but now i’ve gotten to a point i have no desire to eat and no want for it. eating even very small amounts of food put me in physical pain and make me feel sick. i can’t even drink much water anymore. i have so many more fears around food than i did before. and i can just feel something’s different and worse than it ever was before. people don’t really know though because im not underweight currently and when i am it’s not quite as easy to tell as it is for others. idk what this means it just feels sm different and more addicting to me.,167lkn1,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/167lkn1/i_relapsed_recently_and_i_can_tell_this_time_is/,AnorexiaNervosa

1225,A small story from being sent to the hospital,"Like a year ago, I had perhaps one of the funniest things ever happen when it comes to healthcare and such. 

To give some context, at the time I was morbidly obese, however I was already deep as fuck in anorexia, I had a very bad period during which I didn't eat for way way too long, I was passing out almost everyday at least once, had my pulse dip below safe levels, and overall I have never been that sick before or since.

Went to my doctor, he went ""Holy shit"" sent me to the hospital, I agreed, didn't fancy dying.

I get there, tell them I have an ED, due to my size they assume I'm bulimic or have BED or something, had to explicitly tell them I'm anorexic, doctor kinda didn't believe it, asked how much I weigh, I chucked and answered ""too much""... Then I proceed to tell them basically everything in detail. 

I was there for hours and hours, they ran a lot of tests, took a lot of blood, I had severel talks with doctors about different crap...

Anyhow, like 5 or something hours after I got there, this doctor that looks like the chad meme comes in and says something like...

""Most of your results are fine, you have midly low potassium but nothing too alarming, I see no reason for you to stay here, we can't really treat your ED, that's more a thing for the psych clinic, but I can ask of the psych hospital will take you in instead""

I wait another hour...

""Well, the psych hospital sees no reason to take you in unless you're suicidal or severely depressed, to clarify, you're not, right?""

I said ""I'm anorexic ofc I'm fucking depressed... but no I don't want to kill myself""

Then he went ""well in that case I think it's best if you go home, I can write some notes in your files for the psych clinic and... blah blah""

I looked at him like ""wait, for real?""

I guess I'm just gonna have to come back when I'm dying then I guess lmao

Nah seriously its been a year and I still genuinely can't believe they let me go, like at the time I was so sure that I'm gonna stay that I didn't even plan for a way to get home, it was nighttime and my mum had to come fetch me in pitch darkness 

I kinda laugh when I think back at this

I’m at a normal bmi but I’ve lost a lot of weight- to a point where I had to get my gallbladder removed a few weeks ago 

But so I open up to my therapist and she’s like well a hospital wouldn’t admit u at this weight (confirming in my mind that I am not sick enough :/ ) and she told me things such as u can count cals u just need to eat a higher number and was labeling some foods as “bad” (she was saying I just need to eat healthy foods and not fast food) also I “binge” (meaning I’ll eat a fast food meal that a normal person would eat and not feel bad abt) and I was like it’s not really a binge like a normal person would eat this and be ok and she was like well one quesadilla from Taco Bell is not normal or healthy ????????

She also said I wouldn’t gain weight if I just ate clean but at a higher number (I mean I know that’s not true it’s kinda inevitable) 

Basically it triggered me a lot— she’s not a Ed specialist and she has a history of an Ed herself so like I feel very stupid and like I’m not sick enough and it just sucks a lot

1228,Vent/recovery-like info.,"So life's been crazy this summer. But since some things have begun to change for the better, I was happier, but than last night as me and my family were out getting stuff, I saw myself several times in the Target mirrors. Of course the thoughts came ""you look like you're pregnant"", ""wow you're fat"".

If you've seen my posts, I'm anorexic (I know I don't look it, but diagnosed). But I refed last year and went to a place even to try to get help for this. I majorly overshoot my original weight (without knowing or being told until January, not to mention how many times my family and I got sick in the winter and spring time from flu to covid to just sickness which messed with my recovery). So I'm twice the amount that I lost in the first place (rare I'm guessing because I don't hear about many that happens to). I'm trying to remind myself that if I do what people want (a drastic crash MLM, what got me into this mess, well it's further back but more like this onset of things) I'll end up back where I was before or even worse.

It's hard because I think ""I feel comfortable in these clothes"" then I look at myself in that mirror and think of how it makes me look horrible. Add to this, I just got on some birth control pills (for the first time in my life, and I'm old lol) to help with my pmdd (major mood issues). So it makes me want to eat, like before I could ignore but like now I'll try to eat even if it's not a meal. My doctor is happy with how my weight is, I'm not.

I am fully aware of everything because I was in inpatient and outpatient treatment for a year and a half (all together) and I’ve learned everything about eating disorders and patterns and why symptoms occur etc etc but I don’t want to use any of the knowledge I have. 

I am fully aware I am starving myself horribly especially now that I checked my average calorie intake yesterday and realized how low I’ve actually gone (I wasn’t counting during these 2 weeks, just restricting). But I don’t want to stop.

I had 4 pets who were my closest family (I’m NC with my whole family except mom), and 2 weeks ago the last one passed. I am still in therapy because of other disorders I have and I have an appointment on Monday, but I feel that if my therapist (she’s not specialized in eating disorders) tries to get me to go back to healthy eating habits, I will push her away… she’s been the best therapist I’ve ever had and she is very understanding so I hope she won’t push anything on me. 

I’ve made close friends in the treatment program who are thankfully recovered so I don’t want to tell them as not to trigger them, so I’m confessing here… I know one day I’ll get back to being healthy, but right now, I don’t want to.

I thought someone like me couldn’t have ana and even after eating just a piece of lettuce with mustard on it one day I thought it was normal. Family and friends went from praising me to being worried but I never saw it. I went from a few lbs overweight to underweight as an adult man and all I was focused on was losing the next 5. I used to fast for days at a time, too exhausted to do that anymore so I shifted to consistent calories but extreme restriction (less than half TDEE) and at least 2 hours running. I obsessively counted, weighed, prepped and planned meals up to 3 days in advance and scheduled them out to the minute. It sucked every drop of joy out of my life, a couple weeks ago I woke up at 5 am and walked 5 hours until 10 am to justify eating breakfast with my sister and then I just ate an apple and 2 slices of keto toast. Anyway, 2 weekends ago, I ran a self punishing half marathon after bingeing like 4 peanut butter sandwiches and then my heart gave out and I went to the hospital. I was very underweight. I was diagnosed ana 3 or 4 months ago but never cared. This was the wake up call, I thought. So I started recovery, all these awful symptoms like constant crushing fatigue, chest pain, trouble sleeping, night sweats, and joint/muscle pain so bad I’ve been walking on crutches. My legs don’t work. So I’ve stopped running for the first time in ages on top of deleting my calorie counting apps and then of course comes the insatiable hunger. I have not stopped eating the last 10 days, I am so fucking ravenously starving, I am eating more than double TDEE this last week. My whole body is swollen (edema). Today I weighed myself and somehow I gained so many fucking pounds in a week and a half. I can feel the fat in my face, in my stomach, I feel like an obese fat failure and I keep looking at photos of myself at my lw. How did this happen in 10 fucking days.

All I want is to count calories again, suddenly it feels like the planning and strategizing and counting was fun, I miss the excitement of the scale going down, I feel like I lost a part of myself but I don’t want to go back to the hospital.

1248,Call for Feedback - ED App Idea,"Dear Community,

hi! I'm a current psych undergrad working on a project I would love to hear your thoughts on. Please spread the word because Feedback from people affected by eating disorders, especially severe ones, is very valuable in this case.

While working together with people affected by eating disorders for my internship and organising workshops on the topic, I found a common factor that contributes to ED-behaviors, especially in adolescents: calorie counting apps. I was thinking about how this problem could be solved, because usually recommending them to delete the app just leads to them hiding it.

Seeing as bodily hunger and satiety signals aren't very present in people with chronic/persistent EDs, eating within a healthy calorie range also becomes harder.

This lead me to a thought that maybe tracking the things eaten isn't the problem, but it's the numbers. Hm. Maybe an app that tracks calories without showing numbers, just giving a soft colour-coded signal if the user is eating over or under their recommended daily average to get to a healthy BMI which also tracks if the user experienced hunger or satiety signals and offers mindfulness exercises for thoughts of binging/restricting calories.

Target Audience: People with severe/chronic EDs who are severely over/underweight.

Main goal: offer support and promote a healthier relationship with food for those dealing with eating disorders, whether it's overcoming overeating or undereating.  
App Concept:  
The app aims to help users better understand their bodily signals of hunger and satiety. It discreetly tracks calorie intake using color-coding (no numbers), gently guiding users towards their daily caloric goals. The app also includes a mindfulness feature to help cope with binge urges, providing a holistic approach to managing eating habits and emotions.

Your Feedback Matters:  
I would love to hear from you about your thoughts on this app concept. Your insights are incredibly valuable as we work to refine and improve the app. If you or someone you know has experience with eating disorders, your inquiries and feedback would be immensely appreciated. Here are some questions to get the conversation started:

1. Does the app's concept resonate with you? Is it something you believe could offer meaningful support?
2. What features stand out to you the most? Is there anything you would like to see added or adjusted?
3. How do you feel about the color-coded calorie tracking approach? Does it seem like a helpful and sensitive way to approach this aspect?
4. The mindfulness feature is designed to help with coping strategies. What are your thoughts on its potential effectiveness?
5. Any suggestions for app names or additional features that could enhance the overall experience?

Please feel free to share your thoughts, concerns, and questions in the comments. Your input will play a significant role in shaping this project. Let's work together to create a tool that can truly make a positive impact!

Thank you so much in advance!",165h5zy,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/165h5zy/call_for_feedback_ed_app_idea/,AnorexiaNervosa

1251,"A part from a book called ""The Time In Between"" by Nancy Tucker that I wanted to share. It's her hate letter for anorexia. Thought it was beautiful in a weird way.","""Dear Anorexia,

I sometimes wonder why you chose me. I suppose I just looked like an easy target - and I was. Small and soft and defenceless. I suppose you just thought, ""Bingo"". I'd seen you go for others, and certainly heard about the things you could do, but I, being big-headed and simple-minded, thought I would be able to stand up to you. On the surface I was sympathetic to your victims, but inside I scoffed at their ""weakness"". 

When you first started picking on me it wasn't too bad. The chipping away was so gradual it was almost imperceptible. I knew some of the things you were making me do were painful, but I went along with them anyway - I was sure that, in the long run, I would be able to stay on top enough to ensure that I reaped the benefits of the relationship but side-stepped the costs. How naive I was. 

I suppose I should have started getting worried when I realised that you weren't planning on stopping your manipulations any time soon. What I thought was the extent of your torture turned out to be the merest appetiser. You started to twist me, playing sick games with my head. You made me work so hard for rewards you promised to give - except, of course, when the work was done you never coughed up. You never stopped moving the goalposts. 

The worst part was the way you could be the sweetest thing in the world. Kind, caring - you could make me love you so much it hurt. That was always the moment - the moment when you were holding me tight, lifting me high into the air - that you would drop me. And I could never tell which I was going to face - the friend or the foe. You were completely in control; I was a puppet. If you could feel my skeleton then the world was my oyster. If there was too much disgusting, disfiguring flesh masking it, the consequences were dire. Just as you could make me feel like the best of the best, you could instantly turn me into the lowest, most despicable creature on earth. You made me feel like tarnished silver- never bright enough, no matter how hard I polished. 

People began to notice how you were treating me, but they just didn't know how to help. Because some huge, deranged part of me knew the torture you were putting me through but could not - and cannot - stand up to you. You've taken so much from me, and that includes my ability to think logically; to do the right thing. I know that you are spiteful and malicious; that you will never give me all that you promise; that you lie and sneer and take and take and take. You jeer at me constantly, pointedly lavishing your attention on your special, beautiful, other friends. You never seem to be angry with them, it's always me. I suppose I must be the only one who gets so many things wrong. 

You'd think, being able to see all these things, I would be able to shun you once and for all. You make me cold and weak and tired and mean. You make me black out when I stand up and ache all over when I go to bed. When I eat, you make my stomach swell and my skin stretch, and you scream and scream and scream at me until death seems attractive - at least it would be quiet. That's what you make me want - to be so skeletally thin that the only thing left to do is die. 

You're a monster, Anorexia. Skeletal but strong; enticing but evil; comforting but cruel. And yet - despite the taunts and the tricks and the torment - I still feel drawn to you like a helpless magnet. I still don't want you to leave me.

- Nancy""

mine is just really bad. no matter how hard I try I CANNOT look at food and my body a certain, good way. it always has to be ""you could do better"", ""if you didn't eat that or took one less spoon of serving, you'd be better off"",""why did I eat that"", ""purge it when u come back to your room"",""this is fine, but don't eat for 3 days now"". when how when is it going to end ?

I'm going on vacation at the end of the week and I couldn't stop myself from wanting to fast the entire time leading up to it. Except that every time I eat, no matter what I eat, I bloat like crazy. I'm too afraid to not fast but I feel like that will all be for nothing if I look 6 months pregnant the entire time. 

So should I just low restrict leading up to it? Should I high restrict and work out three times the amount I usually do? Will fasting still be worth it because I'll be thinner overall? 

I already know how to generally treat bloating after it happens, but I want to prevent it in the first place. I already take every pro and prebiotic known to man, I eat slowly and plan on doing so on my trip, I go for a walk and do yoga asanas, etc etc etc. I just want to know if I start eating now will I gain weight and bloat on my trip anyway or will it help reduce the bloating so I don't absolutely hate my body while on vacation?

1265,Lack of Estrogen,"A few months ago I somehow slipped into really unhealthy restrictive eating habits. I had some sh problems at that time and always felt left alone at school. All of that + discovering the ed romanticising side of twitter led to developing an  even shittier coping mechanism. 

Anyway I am basically recovered by now but always had some small relapses. I  have visited a doctor because I haven't got my period in over 6 months, after that I made a blood test and they couldn't find any estrogen.

 Another info: I went vegan 2-3 months ago because I always felt so bad for the animals, I looked at many info's about nutrition so I could get all the nutrients I need, I also take my b12 supplement. My parents kind of blame veganism for this issue even tho they know about my issues with food and I'm afraid the doctors/dieticians I will be seeing will also think like this. I don't want to eat animal products again, not because of my ed but because I don't wanna hurt other living beings.

1273,What is your relationship with sugar?,"I am really conflicted and hoping for some perspective.

I've  been in recovery for a while, some issues but I've been pretty  consistent. I have noticed that I often overeat sugar when I eat  ""intuitively"" and it is MAJORLY stressing me out.

It  feels like my only options are 1) to eat without tracking, knowing that  refined sugars are designed to be addictive and knowing I will overeat  them, or 2) start tracking sugar intake/cutting out foods, and  inevitably spiral.

I already don't  eat candy or drink soda, or most baked goods because I have celiacs. I  just like sugar and cream in my oatmeal (so delicious btw) and maybe  something like ice cream a few times a week. It doesn't feel like a lot,  and it makes me happy, but it is objectively too much sugar by national  health standards. I guess I could switch to plain oatmeal in the  mornings, and that type of thing, but that kind of sucks.

I  think even a million grams of sugar per day is probably better for you  than starving, but I also know too much is detrimental to your health. I  feel guilty about how much of it I eat but I also don't want to deprive  myself of something satisfying and comforting. Does anyone else have  experience with this?

She's gone from a starvation amount of calories per day at her worst to something around maintenance amounts or more regularly, plus vitamin supplements, and her physical health has improved a lot. And she's done a fair bit of psychological healing via therapy, but isn't out of the woods yet at all.

And in recent weeks she has recovered enough that she has entered the stage of extreme hunger. The lack of control over her eating and the resulting weight gain is destroying her emotionally. And she's caught in a cycle of over-eating, vomiting, and feeling despair and helplessness.

Does anyone have any tips to offer to get her through this? She's talking like she wants to give up and go back to starvation. Something needs to be done about this out-of-control hunger before she hits a breaking point. She's done so well to get this far and I don't want her to have to re-do her progress all over again.",163uuip,7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/163uuip/gf_is_struggling_hard_with_extreme_hunger/,AnorexiaNervosa

I recovered and from age 18-20 I’ve been recovered. While pregnant I got overweight and got a lot of stretch marks. Now I’m 2 months pp and can’t stand to look at my body anymore. I feel gross and fat and feel like my stretch marks just accentuate the weight I put on. I’ve fallen back into my disordered mental state and it’s consuming me. I’m breastfeeding and don’t want to lose my milk supply, but I want to cry every time I look in the mirror. I loathe my body. I don’t feel sexy or beautiful or cute anymore.

1303,Anybody else here deal with IBS that makes recovery that much harder?,"I've dealt with IBS dating back to age 8 or 9, which coincidentally was around the time I believe I developed extreme anxiety. I've seen a lot of ads regarding new ""research"" saying that IBS is more or less an issue of nerve sensitivity as opposed to food intolerances and gut health/lack thereof like I've believed in the past, which to me makes it sound like IBS is all just psychosomatic (or at least highly influenced by something like anxiety or depression). But at the same time I think it might be congenital/genetic cause a lot of my family deals with it too. (Or maybe we're all just a little mentally ill.)

Basically I'm wondering if anyone here deals with it and if you've found ways to calm yourself mentally and physically during a flare up. Cause for me, when I restrict, I flare up; when I eat good and think I'm listening to my body, I flare up -- just in different ways. It's gotten so much worse every time I've relapsed and I've had this disorder on and off for going on 12 years. Nothing has helped. It feels hopeless and while it's nowhere near the root cause of my ED, it sure makes the body dysmorphia and fear/control surrounding food a million times tougher to deal with.

Also if anyone knows of research regarding the longterm effects of AN on IBS and whether there is the potential for long term worsening of symptoms, please let me know.  🙏",161t4bu,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/161t4bu/anybody_else_here_deal_with_ibs_that_makes/,AnorexiaNervosa

I've also recently had two allergic reactions on my face recently, which I've never had before. My doctor wants me to have a blood test to test for allergies, I'm really afraid to do that - not only because I've never had a blood test before (and it sounds terrifying), but I'm so scared about what they'll find (no one knows about my eating disorders). I told my mum I was too scared to do the blood test, and now she wants to send me to an expensive dermatologist instead for an allergy patch test, and I feel horrible, because we don't have much money at all and I don't want her to waste any on something that won't help find a solution. She's insisting that we go because it's for my health. She doesn't know that I only eat vegetables and egg whites. I can't bring myself to eat anything else right now. I'm eating large enough quantities that I'm not losing any weight. I just don't know what to do.

1314,I never thought I’d relapse again,"TW: Relapsing in multiple ED’s

I thought I was over this.  I wanted to be over this.  I look like im a normal weight now.  But the thoughts are coming back more frequently.  More body checks.  More mental fog.  Pushing back eating.  Eating less when I do.  I’m feeling tired and scared.  I’m trying to be okay and to have courage and eat.  The idea of food sounds…gross at best.  Putting it in my mouth and chewing.  How disgusting.  I’m not sure if it’s the taste that gets me going or the calories but something makes it so repulsive.  I even thought of purging the other day like I used to.  But I avoided it.  I knew if I started I wouldn’t be able to stop.

  My body image is bad.  I have no idea what I look like.  I feel cold all the time.  I won’t allow myself to weigh myself.  I’m not allowed because it will send me into hysterics but I’m so tempted.  I want to feel okay.  I want to feel normal.  Like food is just food.  Like food is just fuel.  But when I think of food it makes me nauseous.  Tears pour from my eyes and my legs shake from the weight I wish I didn’t have.  I hate myself.  I feel.  So.  Disgusting.  I never thought I’d get this bad again.",161bf35,12,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/161bf35/i_never_thought_id_relapse_again/,AnorexiaNervosa
1315,"I think I’m developing an eating disorder, any advice on how to stop?","So, basically I was always someone who loved food, in all ways.
I had my little phases where I would eat less than usual mainly because of things like stress. But as of recently this issue became more serious and I don’t know what to do.


So when I’m at school I usually have my lunch packed. A couple of months ago I would’ve eaten it whole maybe even complaining about not having enough and still being hungry afterwards.

But for a couple of weeks now, I found myself throwing it away after school everyday. And it’s not that I’m not hungry, my stomach hurts most of the time because of that but I just cannot get myself to eat something. Looking at my lunch makes me feel disgusted and sick. It’s like I’m hungry but I don’t have any appetite, for weeks.

It’s come to the point where I’d have my first meal of the day at 10pm and not even that I can eat whole.

For example today, I made myself two small burgers which would usually make me excited and id eat both of them.

I forced myself to eat them both but felt disgusted the whole time. As I took the last few bites I actually almost got sick, even though this is a completely normal portion for me.

I just want to be able to eat normally again.

If anyone has any advice, please let me know",1618bbk,17,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1618bbk/i_think_im_developing_an_eating_disorder_any/,AnorexiaNervosa
1316,I can’t save both of us,"Last night on a long car ride my mom and I got to talking. She told me food disgusts her. She told me she lost an extreme amount of weight. She told me she does not want to get better. 

Now I’m cooking for her, prepping her meals, begging her to eat. She looks at food I made with love with nothing but anger and disgust. She eats once a day.

I am so tired. I have been trying to keep afloat with my own eating disorder my whole life. She never even noticed to this day. I’ve been struggling for months. I can’t help but have really complicated feelings about this. I’m even kind of angry way deep down.

I can’t do this. I need help. If you have any advice, please tell me what to do.

1318,Osteoporosis and osteopenia,"Not sure if this is allowed but I figured you guys might want to know this.

I am currently working in a radiography clinic where we do DEXA BMD (bone mineral densiometry) scans. The DEXA part just refers to the type of machine it is. 

We scan the lumbar spine (low back) and the left hip. We use the scan to determine the density of the bone and to detect whether someone has osteoporosis or osteopenia.

Osteopenia: loss of bone mass or bone mineral density that is lower than what is expected for your age

Osteoporosis: a severe decrease in bone mass and mineral density resulting in structural changes

Both increase your risk of fractures like badly increase. You might cough and fracture something. You shrink. Severe back pain. Hunching of the back. 

Risk factors:
- older age
- female
- hormonal changes (pause in periods, early menopause before 45)
- diet (vitamin D, protein and/or calcium deficiency)
- rheumatoid arthritis
- smoking
- 3+ alcoholic drinks daily
- anorexia nervosa 

I recently had a patient (I will not be divulging any specific identifying information) who suffered from anorexia nervosa.

They had the worst score I’ve seen so far in any patient. I’ve seen old ladies (90+), I’ve seen patients with chronic conditions that put them at higher risk and I’ve seen early menopausal patients. I’ve seen quite a few patients for this scan.

Recovery will not reverse their score. The treatment for osteoporosis or osteopenia is to try to stop it from getting any worse. There’s medications, exercises to build muscle, calcium and vitamin D rich diets. The best treatment is prevention. 

You can stock up on supplements all you want but don’t expect them to stop the progression of bone loss. Research into calcium supplements is inconclusive into whether they work. The best supplement you can get is none. Get it from your diet. 

Vitamin D and calcium work together to prevent bone loss. Vitamin D in your gut helps your body to absorb the calcium. Too little of either and your thyroid releases too much of their hormones leading to weakened bones (hyperparathyroidism).

Stay safe and feel free to correct any unintentional misinformation. To the best of my knowledge this is all correct.",160vgf5,7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/160vgf5/osteoporosis_and_osteopenia/,AnorexiaNervosa

1324,I want to recover,"For the last few days the word skinny has overtaken my mind & I want to recover. I am no longer underweight, I was at my lowest weight 4 years ago & again just over 1 year ago. I truly wish I had never gotten there. If I hadn’t gotten so small, i wouldn’t know how great it was. It all started on accident as a result of being broke and depressed when i moved out of my parents. I lost half my body weight in a year and people loved it, they didn’t care how it happened or even ask, they just said I looked great. All. The. Time. Skinny privilege. 

I have struggled ever since then, going between getting close to that weight again via restriction and wanting to recover so I start focusing on protein and recovery. No matter what i’m doing, skinny is always on my mind. If my thighs touch, I hate myself. 

Does anyone really ever recover? So much so that the voice in their head doesn’t speak up anymore? I’ve never believed it’s possible & i still don’t but I really hope it is. How do I actually recover?

 I’m staying at my mother’s right now, and she insisted on weighing me. Insisted.

Of course she flipped out - little did she know it’s not even my real weight. I get why she freaked, but why on earth does she then have to be cruel and downright nasty? She proceeded to skinny shame me, with “You look horrible in a pair of skinny jeans” and “you’re too skinny, it’s unattractive”, “people will think you’re anorexic, they’ll talk about you behind your back” (hello - what do you think I am, mother?) and she went on and on, culminating in how the way I look results in not only damage to my reputation and opportunities, but hers. What’s also crazy is how when she’s watching tv, she’ll point to models and actresses and say “she’s skinner to an you!” or “she’s as skinny as you!” like this is somehow helpful?? I don’t know - she still doesn’t believe I have an ED, thank God.

And then she said that every time I stay with her she’s going to feed me full of one of my biggest fear foods - pasta and cream sauces.

So yeah. I love mums. So much fun. And I know I must sound embittered but right now I am. She’s made me paranoid about the way I look, she’s shamed and insulted my body, she’s triggered me regarding my weight, and she’s threatened me with food (as dumb as it sounds I know) she knows I “don’t like” (or in my own words an afraid of).

During 2020 I didn't get my period at all and between 2021-2022 I got for maybe 8-10 months (of 24 and not in a roll), but I still was restricting and it'd be maybe 2, 3 days.

I know I'll have to see a doctor (and I'm making an appointment right now!) to see what's exactly the cause, but does anyone go/went through the same thing? Does it have some thing to do with my eating disorder or is something totally different from it? Is it my body taking its revenge on me? 

Any comment is welcome. Thank you!",15yfurr,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15yfurr/dae_experiences_really_bad_period_cramps_after/,AnorexiaNervosa
1347,My only secret,"I’ve always struggled with body image issues in my childhood but with age, it grew with me. It grew into something bigger than me. I am 23F and everyday I get worse. I feel myself wasting away but my thoughts don’t change. It makes me cry knowing how I truly feel inside and I have no one to express it to. Those who I’ve HAD to tell depending on the situation, never bothered to ask about it again. Not their responsibility but it does take a toll knowing if they don’t care, why should I…. My boss offered me the rest of her chicken minis today and told me “I need some sustenance” while looking me up and down. I wear baggy clothes, always. Sometimes I feel the way I want to, and I’ll wear a tight top. I’m unsure why she would say that, would she have said that to anyone else? Was it just for me? I took the minis because of the pressure and as I googled the calories, I ate 3. After finding out how many was in the serving, I threw the rest away. I remember every single calorie I eat. I can’t stop punishing myself for eating to survive. Penalizing myself for “nutrition” even though I don’t see it that way. 

There is no question to this.

What do people consider as extreme hunger? I’m 3 months into recovery and I’m still eating a lot. In the beginning of recovery I was eating 10-8k calories a day and now I’m eating around 4000 calories a 3 month into recovery. I’m scared that my extreme hunger will never pass and that it will take 4000 calories for the rest of my life to get full. Getting full from eating 2000-3000 calories a day seems so unrealistic and something I’m never going to be full from? I have heard someone saying that anything above 3500 calories is extreme hunger - is that true?

1349,Any Dutch ppl on here?¿ What can I expect from ED treatment?,"Title speaks for itself.
I have a so called 'diagnosis day'  where they'll run all sorts of tests on me and have conversations along with my family, I'll get my diagnosis and treatment advice at the end of the day. Just curious as of what I can expect from it, I've never actually been treated for mental health before and it makes me a bit nervous that I don't know what's exactly going to happen. Non-dutch ppl can comment too about their experience of course but I'm mainly interested in how treatment works here, can't really find specific information on the internet and it's better to hear it from someone who has actually gone trough it. 

I'm suspecting they'll give an anorexia diagonisz. either restrictive or purging idk, cuz I do purge but there's probably criteria on how frequently it happens and for me it comes and goes in periods. It's not sth that I do consistently, so could also be ednos maybe.

1353,relapse (no triggers) would appreciate encouraging words/advice,"hello :)
first I’ll start with some background: i’ve struggled with orthorexia and anorexia for years and this last december i was forced into recovery. 
at first, I didn’t cooperate but eventually realized it would get me nowhere - and i realized I want to recover.
so I gained weight and ate my meal plan, stopped using laxatives and overall got better. there were obviously ups and downs but you know, I did it. and for a while I was actually doing better, ate out and ate however much I wanted. I’m not gonna lie, I still had disordered behaviors and still restricted whenever I could but not as heavily as I used to and I maintained my weight. I would also like to add that I’m a female, I’m 19 and still live at home.
recently though, I had to stop overexercising due to poor physical health (i’m not sure it’s related tbh) and I also started restricting heavily again. I also lost weight. 
the thing is, that I would’ve totally let it go down bad again, but I can’t afford that to happen. I have plans for the near future and I can’t let myself get low again. I have a beautiful fiancée that cares about me and loves me, my family is overprotective and would definitely notice, my dietitian who I don’t want to disappoint, and I absolutely CANNOT go ip as it would fuck up everything i’m working for. 
I’m lost, and i don’t know how to stop it. i don’t WANT to stop it but I know I need to. 
I’m scared, I’m so deadly scared of gaining weight again, of every food to ever exist. i don’t fucking know how to stop this and i’m going crazy. 
if you read it all i’m so thankful, I would love advice/words of encouragement.

I’ve been fighting a full blown relapse for a few weeks now and I finally had a meltdown tonight. Early at dinner I was putting food in my bowl: rice, and teriyaki turkey with broccoli mixed in, and my fiancée asks me “are you sure you’re going to eat *all* of that?” And I just… I felt bad about how much I had gotten but I shook it off fine enough. After I ate though I felt sooo guilty and I seriously thought about uneating my dinner. Then a few minutes ago we went to the kitchen so she could get food and she grabbed the leftovers and said “this is mine since you ate so much at dinner” and again…I just…it triggered me. I was going to make a small sandwich for myself and I pulled out the cheese and I just lost it. I had a full blown meltdown right there at the fridge with the door open and just sobbed into my hands because WHY AM I LIKE THIS. I HATE the fact that someone just making passing comments about what I’m eating has such an effect on me and I HATE how much this controls my life and my mind and my happiness. Why am I like this…

I would be sat at my table from about 5 years old, till late into the night, until I had eaten or hidden my food till my plate looked clean. I now struggle to know when I'm full and it makes recovery hard because I go all or nothing.
Like if I have a food I feel obliged to eat it all because;
1. Starving children exist and id be a monster in the back of my head if I wasted the food
2.i hear my parents calling me a variety of names if I threaten to leave a single crumb.
3. Where I am rn you cannot hide food, not that these people mind you leaving food on plates but it feels like i'll get in trouble or yelled at 
4. I DONT KNOW IF IM FULL?  Idk how common this is but I haven't ever really experienced fullness. Obviously when I was a kid I would say I'm full 24.7 so I could try to escape meals, to no avail.. my parents and grandparents never let me leave food so now no matter the size of what I eat I dont feel full.
(Tw binge) for example earlier i think I should have felt full as I ate a large pizza, a family bag of popcorn, a family chocolate bar, pasta salad, a wrap and some crisps. I didnt feel full. I also had biscuits.

1357,Relationship advice,"
I would really like some comments or advice for my current relationship.

My (21M) boyfriend (21M) struggles with anorexia. and has been bulimic in the past. He's very open and honest about his struggles and feelings which is really good for us both.

Personally, I have struggled with weight, but not disordered eating. A few years ago in highschool, I had dropped A LOT of weight due to being depressed and not leaving my room but my weight loss was not intentional. I hated how skinny I got, even tho I was now a healthy weight and no longer overweight. It freaked me out for so long because I had never intended on losing weight and at the time I wasn't 100% aware of what mental illness was. I would dream of gaining all the weight back just because I was happier mentally. i’m doing much better now and got diagnosed with bipolar type II and i’ve just been on my journey to healing. 

Anyways, back to my point. I’m not exactly sure how to be there for my boyfriend 100% and I don’t know the right things to say sometimes. I’m still very supportive and helping as best as i can. I know that I can’t fix anything. it is just very hard for me to completely understand an eating disorder, because I struggled with the opposite perception of my body (sorta). Also, sometimes he does make little harmless jokes, calling me fat and obviously i don’t take it serious because i know im not fat at all. However, sometimes it’s hard for me to know if he actually is serious, and is  projecting his insecurities on to me. I feel like I could never bring these things up though, because i don’t wanna be a “trigger” for him.  I just feel like this is a huge thing that needs to be dealt with soon because i am concerned for him and i also don’t want to start questioning my own body (i rlly hope that doesn’t sound selfish) I do truly love this man and want the best for us both!",15xrju8,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15xrju8/relationship_advice/,AnorexiaNervosa

1362,“At least your not physically ill!”,"These past six months have been hell. I’ve been restricting more than ever before, without losing weight. The few times I’ve lost weight these past six months, it haven’t been a lot and only temporarily. Therefore, I’ve continued restricting as much as possible. But for the past two weeks, I’ve felt like crap. Both physically and mentally. My hands and feet turn blue whenever I get cold, and I get cold for hours by drinking cold beverage or being exposed to cold winds. I have headaches almost everyday, I get really bad spells of dizziness, my bones and muscles ache, and my heart skips beats. Additionally, my hair is thinning at the front, and I’ve gotten a receding hairline. More than usual at least. I had my blood drawn a couple of months ago or so, and they all came back clear. Which again gave me motivation to continue with my restrictive eating habits. But it’s really discouraging that I can’t seem to lose any weight/every weight loss is short lived. Anyways, my therapist thinks I’m doing completely fine, since I’ve actually GAINED WEIGHT. And when she weighed me today, I had gained again. Even though I practically ate air the entire weekend. I couldn’t sleep at all last night, because I was so hungry. Yet I still gained weight. I reported this weight gain back to my parents, because they want to keep updated on how I’m doing weight wise. I don’t know in exact numbers what I weigh, not that I would mention any numbers here anyways. But I usually just tell them wether or not I’ve gained. When I texted my dad and told him that I’d gained, he responded with: “I’m glad you’re physically well and able to live a normal life, and doing everyday tasks.” His response made me upset and I wrote to him that even though I’m categorized as physically well, I’m very unwell mentally. And I also told him that having AN isn’t any less severe just because one is weight restored. He then answered with: “well, it’s better that you are physically well, rather than physically unwell and mentally unwell at the same time.” Argh, I’m still so mad!!! He doesn’t have a clue about my physical symptoms, and I most definitely do not feel physically fine. I’m not motivated at all to recover. I wasn’t motivated earlier today before I texted my dad either. But his claims triggered me, and now I’m just completely discouraged and I feel disgusted with myself.

1368,Imagining my life without FBT brings up a lot of grief. Not sure how to move forward.,"I am feeling very sad and suicidal, as I have been for quite some time. I do not mean to depict FBT as inherently ""bad"", especially if you think it might be a helpful form of treatment. However, it hurt me badly. Trigger warning for mentions of self-harm, suicidality, eating disorder behaviors, etc.

My parents forced me in FBT last May, right when I graduated from high school. A lot has happened since then... many things I would rather not remember. Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if I had not gone through FBT and had instead pursued professional outpatient care with my current treatment providers instead.

I was medically stable at the time and generally willing to try new/fear foods in moderation (e.g., I bought cupcakes when grocery shopping with my mother and had one or two that week, and my family went out to eat around once per week). Maybe I would have learned to associate the occasional slice of pizza, cheesecake, etc., with something positive. Maybe I would have enjoyed the food from my Chinese heritage (*baozi*, dumplings, congee, etc.) again instead of associating all my fear foods and ethnic foods with mental breakdowns and the feeling of terrible bloating, nausea, sickness, and rapid forced weight gain.

Maybe there would be some lingering ED behaviors and thoughts, but I would be, overall, ""okay"". I would not have developed the unhealthy habit of spitting out my food because the way my parents plated my meals and snacks meant so much sugary, oily food that it made me sick... and even after spitting out a lot of food, I still gained weight at an unhealthily rapid rate and felt sick from the food I did swallow.

I would not have used unsafe methods to fake my weights, since my mother and the FBT treatment team expected me to be at a borderline overweight BMI incongruous with the conclusions made by ED dietitians I consulted outside the program. The habit nearly put me in a coma twice (so please, *please* do not do it), all the while being weighed by my mother twice a week. I would not have started self-harming to cope with the hurtful words said and my worsening suicidality... now, I have scars on my left arm and stomach. I would not have nearly attempted suicide twice.

Maybe I would have gone to college last year instead of being forced to take a gap year. Even if I ended up taking a gap year, I might have had a more enjoyable time. No more being weighed by my mother, insensitive comments about my eating and weight and how weight gain essentially cures my ED and depression. No more threats to my job, access to transportation, etc. Fewer power struggles about my medical rights as an adult. Maybe I would have taken a nice vacation overseas to Japan or to visit my relatives in China. Maybe my relationship with my parents (not the best before FBT but certainly reasonable) would not have deteriorated to the point where being around them triggers such severe avoidance, fear, suicidality, and mental instability.

Now, all I am is suicidal, mentally unwell, and so hurt that I do not know what to do anymore. I know, logically, staying at home is not a good idea, but I am so tired of living that going to college next week feels exhausting. I feel strangely old (probably because I am suicidal) and so, so sad. I am sad because of the things that have happened, but also because of what I have lost and what could have been.

secondly, i’ve upped my intake to MAINTENANCE for the past 3 weeks and gained weight. i dont know how thats possible, its just confusing to me. i know peiod loss slows your metabolism so i feel like it might be related.

1376,Advice... my family is getting together and they trigger me... need advice!!!,"I'm currently in a really bad relapse and at my lowest... my lowest in terms of mental health and my lowest weight ever... needless to say I am not doing well... my family is getting together this Wednesday for my niece's and sister's birthdays and last time I saw my family was back in April. Last time I saw them my other sister (not the one who's birthday it is) gave me nasty/dirty looks ever time I talked to her about everything/all n8ght for no reason. My mother was also ""sneaking"" food in the kitchen because God forbid she's seen eating more than the little bit on her plate she'd be a ""pig"" (*her words not mine). Both my sister and my mother triggered the crap out of me and on my way home I was a complete mess, thankfully my husband was driving but he had to deal with me breaking down and calling myself horrible things... my breakdown went on for days if not weeks after my visit. My family hasn't said a single thing to me about my relapse and it's clear as day what I'm going through! My sister (the one who was giving me dirty looks) both myself and my husband took care of her all last year when she was going through cancer treatment, so I was extremely hurt by her behavior/looks at dinner. No one in my family was caring or supportive in the past when I was struggling with ED/anorexia, rather I am told I am a ""drama queen"" lol I literally am the furthest thing from that but everyone is allowed there opinion...

I’m still underweight and less than I was before my relapse but god it’s so hard to stay motivated.

Before I developed an ed she was always eating little portions of food and very healthy, saying that sugar is poison and a drxg.

She always rants about gaining a bunch of weight because of me and that she is “overeating for her age” just to encourage me to eat more.

what’re your opinions on this? is it a good idea to keep an eye on my calories, because it feels odd to not know exactly what i’ve eaten. i’m
honouring my cravings, but counting them. or is this a bad idea?

1390,I am not sure why I should continue to live... I am tired of my mind. I have been suicidal for years.,"I (19F) have had anorexia for five years and depression and suicidality for at least seven. I hate myself so much -- my body, my personality, the trouble I cause my parents by having this illness and not pursuing ""full recovery"". I hate that I should love my parents, but there is so much pain... when I am around them, I easily become suicidal and break down mentally. I hate my selfish thoughts and privilege.

I hate that, despite anorexia being an illness that has isolated me in high school, caused health problems, etc., I cannot easily let go of it completely. I am afraid that, when it disappears, all this self-loathing will implode and kill me directly. Somehow, anorexia is my way of coping... of asking someone to please care for me, love me... for me to feel smaller and younger (both of which I associate with happier times).

My mind is a mess. Sometimes random details or changes in the atmosphere (light, location, sound, etc.) trigger bad memories and/or phrases my family said in the past like a broken record. They mix in with my own voices of self-hatred. 10 months of FBT left a lot of scars, too. I am tired of being so torn up and sad, of being incapable of caring for myself... of it all being my fault.

I am scared of college... scared of the new environment and this destructive self-image. I am terrified of losing my academic achievements since classes are so difficult. Without a good personality, academics were almost all I had in high school. I cannot bear living as myself. I am scared of being rejected and scorned, for people leaving me once they know of my mental conditions. I am sad that anorexia is genetic... that I am not sure anyone will come to love me without so much hurt. I am afraid I will never learn how to love someone else.

I just want to be ""normal"" and live an ordinary, peaceful life, but my mind is scrambled from the fear, pain, and sorrow. It feels much deeper than depression, but I am not sure what it is. I wish someone could help.",15u7gx3,27,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15u7gx3/i_am_not_sure_why_i_should_continue_to_live_i_am/,AnorexiaNervosa

I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin, that I even wore long trousers & tops to cover my anorexic looking arms on the hottest summer days. 
Even though I HATED being severely underweight & people constantly staring at me, I could not gain even a kg. 
After I was basically forced to gain weight, as my school was very concerned about my health, I managed to gain 5 kg. Still, I was severely underweight.

I can’t see, how I’m supposed to have anorexia, as I basically have NO typical anorexia symptoms: I never restricted eating, I never felt being too fat. I know that I just don’t / didn’t look normal. Why would she diagnose me with anorexia? I have also recurrent depression & generalized anxiety disorder. 
I also feel hopeless, as after 1 year of therapy I’m still not able to gain weight: I’m seriously suffering, as I basically miss out on life: dating with anorexia ist difficult (I mean I still get guys, but im so ashamed of my body… I just don’t want them to see me naked), I am constantly exhausted, zero energy, almost never meet friends.

Hope you’re doing well!

I wanted to reach out and get some advice. My boyfriend has known me for 3 years now, but we only recently started dating. We’ve been long distance this entire time, but when I was at my lowest and went to outpatient, I confided mainly in my support group there and not my him/my friends (I’m sure y’all can guess why). To make things worse, I have ARFID on top of Anorexia, so I have really struggled. When we’ve been together, he has not judged me at all for my struggles and he does his best to make sure we both eat. He really tries his best. 

Unfortunately, my Anorexia has really gotten the best of my recently and I’ve started restricting and then eating normally and I sling-shot between the two. My boyfriend does his best to be supportive, but he does not have an ED so he can’t relate. I normally don’t tell him about my EDs because I don’t know how to even properly express myself. I know he wants to know, I just….feel so ashamed, you know? But i want to properly express myself and my worries, but just don’t super know how to approach it. Does anyone have any advice???

1405,Help with Binging,"I was diagnosed with atypical anorexia 4 months ago by eating disorder specialists. I was heavily restricting my food intake and got down to my ideal weight of 165lbs. However, now that I have been in treatment with the eating disorder specialists, I have been gaining weight and dropping a lot of the restrictions I had around what I ate and when I ate. I feel as though my discipline around eating and maintaining my ideal weight is being lost, I just don’t have the will power anymore to avoid high calories foods. Due to this, I believe my atypical anorexia is now turning into binge eating disorder. This is because now that so many of my restrictions and restrictive behaviours that kept me at a healthy body weight have been lost due to the eating disorder program and my overall willpower going down. Now I have huge binge eating sessions where I end up eating massive amounts of high calorie food that adds up to around 8,000-10,000cal. These behaviours never used to happen as I had the willpower to avoid these foods and maintain not over eating, but now I just can’t seem to have the discipline around food and I just give in. I now weigh 185lbs which is 20lbs more than I want and I can’t seem to stop gaining or binging and the eating disorder program isn’t helping.

1410,Looking for advice,"Hey everyone!! 
This is my first time posting here so please bear with me... (I've read all the rules and am hoping this follows them) 

So I'm currently in a DBT program for my anorexia among other things and I have about a month left of group and then another 2 months-ish of individual  we've started thinking about what comes next and I basically have two options... 

I can continue my eating sort of as is ( fasting more days than not ) and be referred to ED Services who probably won't even accept (which I would then likely have no support) because Ive done the program once and been referred several more times to them on top of that, that they've denied in the past. Or I can be eating everyday and do a further 6 months of individual therapy with my current therapist but the anorexia needs to be under control. 

I have decided I'm going to aim to be eating everyday ( because either way that's inevitable and I'd like to continue with my current therapist to work on the other things) but I'm struggling immensely with the guilt, distress, anxiety etc. and looking for how others have gotten through this ? For context I live alone so I have to be the one to get myself to eat, there's no one to encourage me. 

I have been hospitalised before and been fed through an NG and this whilst distressing was more manageable to get into that regular eating because 1. I'm not tasting the food 2. I could do it whilst asleep and not have to push through as much distress and once it's regular slowly introduce food... But I don't know if this is an okay thing to try in the community? I feel guilty for even thinking about suggesting that... Thoughts on that too or if anyone's done it I'd appreciate hearing about that too...",15sklsv,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15sklsv/looking_for_advice/,AnorexiaNervosa

1413,In a relationship with someone with an eating disorder,"i’m in a serious relationship (now 1yr) with someone who has suffered with an ed on and off. He has started spending some time with my family recently. My family is really important to me. The moments when we are all truly together is around the dinner table. My boyfriend was unable to bring himself to the table for dinner when I invited him to stay with us at the lake. He’s uncomfortable eating in front of other people. He is new to the family so when he skipped out on dinner it was hard to explain away. If we are going to be serious I want to invite him to more family gatherings. However if he can’t be at the table with me it presents a challenge. They all love him but it can be hard for some people to understand why someone wouldn’t want to come sit with them. Dinner is usually 2 hours, usually we stay and talk even after we eat. Is he going to run off every time we come together at the table? Unfortunately, it makes me think twice about inviting him to future family gatherings. That might be a barrier in our relationship. I just don’t know how to handle this. I know his issues have resurfaced the past few weeks but he doesn’t really get into it. I’m ok with that. I told him I support him and i’m always here to listen if he wants to talk. I hate to see him suffer and I feel guilty even thinking about my feelings on this. I’ve struggled with mental health and some body insecurity but not with an ed. I don’t know how to handle this and I don’t want to be a part of the problem. I love him and want to support him.

Anyways I’m really sorry for the dumb rant dump while I’m at work I think everyone is entitled to an opinion I just have noticed a lot of ed folk upset and as valid as everyone is for being upset we all need to talk more to make it more known what eds can look like because not everyone knows a lot about them and some people don’t know that they have them🤷🏼‍♀️",15r4yz0,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15r4yz0/unpopular_opinion_but/,AnorexiaNervosa
1422,How do I know when I need to ask for a doctors help?,"to start - i have always been a bit on the chubbier/bigger side, have dealt with anorexia throughout most of my life on and off, my therapist diagnosed me this year with anorexia due to my restricting (as far as i know, my doctors do not know abt this diagnosis)

the past few weeks i have been eating less and less, but this past week i cannot seem to get much at all down. i feel so nauseous whenever i get hunger pains that i can't bring myself to eat when i am hungry. thinking about food makes me nauseous. smelling any food makes me nauseous to the point where i have to physically walk away from the plate. i've never been at this point before so i don't really know what to do. i've been getting dizzy lately anytime i move too fast, especially when i shower (i feel the closest to possibly fainting in the shower), and i've never experienced dizziness from my anorexia in the past.

it's scaring me a little bit but its hard because i like the fact that i am loosing weight. this year i've lost a lot of weight so far and i see my doctor consistently due to medication check-ins (im 20, still with my pediatrician) and my weight loss has not been mentioned once by my doctor once.  i feel like since i started in a bigger body and my weight loss is seen as something congratulatory the doctor doesn't see a problem, so i dont necessarily want to stop the problem, ya know?

essentially, i just want to know if dizziness is a big indicator or anything that i should contact my doctor and begin trying to take recovery seriously a bit (a lot) more. i very much so don't want to and i just want to see what like-minded individuals who have experienced this have to say. i am also very curious if anyone else has experienced intense nausea from the thought and scent of any food? its the biggest thing that is preventing me from trying to get any genuine help right now (i have a severe phobia of throwing up, so forcing myself to eat while nauseous is something i'm just not willing to do right now unless i'm convinced otherwise really).

anything anybody has to say is greatly appreciated. i've never posted or spoken to anybody about this outside of my therapist and i think itll be nice to hear perspectives from others that are dealing with the same thing. <3 <3

1425,Relapse…don’t know if I will be able to come back from it this time.,"TW: trauma/abuse

*
*
*

The past few years my anorexia b/p subtype got the worst it’s ever been; the lowest weight I’ve ever been, mostly due to a a long abusive relationship that came to a head with a severely traumatic domestic violence incident, which the anniversary of is creeping back up in about a week. I nearly died in January after being found passed out on my bathroom floor for about 16 hours - my body temperature was 90, they had to intubate me and give me chest compressions. I was extremely underweight, but even without inpatient or formal treatment, something in my body just made me eat and keep it down. I gained a massive amount in a short period, up to around a healthy weight. As much as my ED didn’t like it, I’m glad I did, because I’ve had gastrointestinal problems a few times since where I couldn’t even keep water down, and accidentally lost some…

…that and the reminder of my abuse and trauma coming up has triggered me. I’m so worried. I’ve now lost about half of what I had put on. And I know it’s a slippery slope to just keep going & lose the rest…but then I’ll be right back where I started, a half-dead ghoul that can barely walk - only it would be worse because my body will be weaker. I can’t keep cheating death. I’m trying to be easy on myself because I know this trauma has a lot to do with my mental state, but don’t want to give myself a pass, either. I’m in therapy but it’s not really helpful; they mean well but don’t know a lot about EDs. Inpatient or even PHP isn’t a financial option for me. 

I don’t know if I want advice to help myself or to just scream into the void. Regardless, I’m so sad that so many of us are struggling, and super proud of those that have overcome this nightmare. ♥️",15qyhhv,9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15qyhhv/relapsedont_know_if_i_will_be_able_to_come_back/,AnorexiaNervosa

1428,Thank you for sharing your struggles. It's very comforting to read your posts and to know I'm not alone.,"I'm spiraling - hard. I'm so hard on myself. I thought I'd be through with this as I'm an (albeit young) adult and have been dealing with this bullshit since the day I could eat on my own... But no. 

I have some extremely unhealthy coping mechanism, particularly C&S, anything over a very small amount of calories terrifies me. All day, every minute, is just food and numbers. I'm basically a walking, talking scale/calculator this point. 

I'm incredibly fucking frustrated because the last bit of weight just won't come off, no matter what I do - although I'm in the upper half of my healthy BMI and it should be possible. 

I'm very scared. When will my organs have enough? I basically eat like a toddler. I'm constantly dizzy, feel weak, tired. Memory loss. I don't know how much longer my body can take it. Just a bit longer, just a few more kilos until I am where I want to be at... 

We all know this is a lie. Maybe I will never be free. This disease is taking everything I am and turning it into a crotesque caricature of a person. Everything is tainted. 

Yet I can't let go. I just can't. I feel a sick sense of pride anytime I ""win"" over my body, like I have to prove to myself that I'm in control over it - although we are literally fighting the same fight. Part of me wonders whether the endgoal isn't control or ""proving"" myself... It's to ultimately vanish, to turn into thin air. 

Nobody knows. I have a big network, I'm just so fucking ashamed (just for all the wasted food alone, God...). It's too complicated to explain, too fucked up, too disgusting. They wouldn't understand, or worse - push me into forced recovery. My partner knows more than other people and thankfully, they are very understanding, very supportive as in they make an effort to not trigger me. But that can only go so far and it's my issue to deal with, not theirs. I lead a double life. I'm a liar.

But I'm sure I don't have to explain. Because you get it. It's scary to see myself in almost every post on here, but at the same time, I find comfort in the fact that I'm not alone. I'm very sorry you all are struggling, and I commend your courage to share your stories.

Today I visited one of my best friends in the hospital because he has to get heart surgery so I bought his favorites. M&ms and chocolate chip muffins from Trader Joe’s. I let myself have a muffin and we hung out for a while in the day room playing cards and all of that. On my way home, my mom told me that she’s proud of me for allowing myself to eat that stuff without guilt. I left my body and instantly thought about calories and how horrible it is that I can see a food and name it’s caloric number. I got home and cried in the shower. I take a laxative for my ibs and I haven’t abuse them in a while. However, along with my dicyclomine, I took a lot A LOT of miralax. Like three servings. It’s an hour later, I’m sitting in bed and crying because my stomach hurts, I feel tired and nauseous and my I have a sort of throbbing pain in my ribs. I know I’ll be okay later but I also know that I fckedup my recovery. I’ve never taken this amount of laxatives before today. I feel like I could shit my pants and throw up all at once. I hate it.

1431,declining further.,"

*tw everything*


I have long avoided something acknowledging my own fault in this disease, nor have I vented about my disease online, in all fairness and guilt, I have usually promoted it to others to ease my own sick mind. The days of this psyche being attractive and quirky, have past, the days of it being concerning to others have passed, the days of it being concerning to myself have past. I have lost interest gaining further formal knowledge and keeping up with things that associate with eds, along side the communities tethered to them. Though, *I* have stayed sick the entire time…   I simply cannot win. I believe I have waited too long, burned far too many bridges, and have lost too much health and mind to invest in my future, nor am I necessarily interested in such. From my organs dying, upward - my teeth are falling apart, my gums are diseased, my throat is scarred and burnt, my voice is barely hanging on, and heart is waiting for a moment to give out. I spent years in storms of self harm threats, yet I don’t speak to anyone in any capacity anymore, no one gets it from the source, I am simply keeping this to myself. 
It seems unavoidable to not address while speaking as dramatic as this, I am overly aware I am most-likely not surviving this kind health for the near future. Between 6+ years of constant substance use, a revolving door of extreme restriction relapses, and throwing up damn near everything I have ate since, it seems there is too much, too much that is now permanent. I can only speak through an internet voice box, but I couldn’t be any happier if any of you were safer with this practise, please don’t mistake yourself like I did, for as long as I did. *Let it* be a *phase* that you work yourself out of, that your grow and blossom from, *be* alarmed when you start throwing up the blood in the toilet after purging, please listen to your body, you are gambling with your lives, I promise. I promise, I have given an infinite number of offerings to this disease, none of which hold any worth knowing what I know now. I know it hurts, it has always hurt, for me, and for you, more than I could ever understand, so I won’t give an attempt, so please, value yourselves, value health, value your mind.",15qlmh3,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15qlmh3/declining_further/,AnorexiaNervosa

when i told my parents that night, because i was being pressed for details, my dad laughed at me. i know he wasn’t trying to make me feel bad, maybe it was just a nervous laugh. but in that moment, for the first time, i pushed my not empty plate away from me and left the table hungry. it was in that moment that i decided, i didn’t need to keep eating. my body had enough fat to lose that any weight loss would be healthy right? 
wrong. 
fast forward 3 years. i am a regular at my local clinic. i have gone through a plethora of help problems and my brain was mush for so long. i am now a size small / medium, size 8-10. the pro ana’s out there are probably laughing but, i used to be a 4XL and a size 24 pants. i now weigh 132 pounds and i cannot seem to stop losing. I don’t want to lose anymore. My body is still deformed, just in a different way. My boobs and butt are gone, although i’ve got some sick ass collar bones and a really good jawline. never thought those bones even existed for me. 
anyway. i have no way of getting real nutrition anymore. rarely i will get an appetite that lasts long enough for me to find something to eat. most times, it’s gone before i can even think of what to make. 
my goal is to start going to the gym to gain muscle and try to tone the loose skin. it’s tragic really, there’s a chance i would be underweight now if i could get rid of this hanging fat. 
i know when vegetarians go back to meat that sometimes their bodies can’t handle it anymore and reject it and they can’t ever go back. i’m scared that’s what’s happened to me with chicken for example. 
any tips? maybe a workout you like or high protein drinks or meals?",15pzxrx,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15pzxrx/recovering_anorexic_usually_cant_eat_even_when_i/,AnorexiaNervosa

But the little I read seems to consistently bring up the fact that ur supposed to gain weight in recovery even if you're not underweight.

I'm not underweight, far from it, in fact if I gain weight now I'd be obese again. 

I have been considering getting into treatment, perhaps even going to a treatment centre, basically residential.

1447,I hate myself and my body.,"To preface, I am a male. I have anorexia binge-purging sub-type, and my life is a nightmare. I am also a major loner, and often lock myself in my room for most of the day so that I don't have to see anyone, or have them see me. I hate talking to people, and find it exceptionally tiring to do so. I am also about to go to university.

I am so scared for school. I will be sharing a room with another person, and I don't know how I am going to survive it. I often rock quietly to calm down or rub a towel against my face, and that is how I calm down at night, and I feel like I'll be too embarrassed to do this with someone else near by. However, I can't calm down without these behaviours.

Furthermore, where the AN-BP comes into play, I have very rigid behaviours around food. Further complicating this, I hate eating in front of people. I can't describe why, but it is the most uncomfortable feeling. Like ""someone is watching me use the loo"". But I am sharing a space with 10 other people, so I don't even know how I am going to bloody eat in this situation.

To top this off, anytime I see a girl who looks somewhat similar to me, it is almost a painful sensation, a mixture of jealousy and sharp, painful sadness. I want to be them, but I know that I never can be. I have struggled with this silently since I was a little kid. However, I realised in middle school that this wasn't normal, but I convinced myself that I was simply being a kid with too much internet access and that this wasn't an actual problem, so I never told my parents.

I am miserable because I know that if I had just told my parents about my problems when I realised that I hated my body when I was in middle school, I would have had the necessary support for my issues from a young age, but now, I am old enough that I feel like a lost cause, like there is no point seeking help because my problems are too deeply ingrained.",15prjgl,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15prjgl/i_hate_myself_and_my_body/,AnorexiaNervosa
1448,my family friend's photo of me eating ice cream is triggering my ed,"Hi, reddit. This is my first reddit lost.

I labeled this NSFW because there's small mentions of my (kind of) past anorexia. 

I (17f) am trying to recover from anorexia. About 3 months ago, I was visiting my brother (35m), and his friend who considers himself to my brother, too (26m) has this thing where he takes photos of people to make funny stickers on whatsapp.

The whole time I was visiting my brother and his wife (37f), which was 4 months, they were calling me ugly, so I feel like I can't trust them. When I told them that I had anorexia, they (expecially my SIL) started calling me fat and making fun of me. 

Sometime in that, my brother's friend took a candid photo of me eating ice cream. I tried to be okay for so long, but it kills me on the inside. 

(TW: insecurity and *norexic thoughts)

I feel so hurt knowing that people have photos of me eating ice cream. It triggers my anorexia, and remembering that they have a photo of me eating ice cream makes me want to never eat again until I'm all bones. 

(*norexic thoughts over)

What should I do? I feel like the photos of me eating ice cream are prohibiting me from receiving properly.

1449,When do u give up,"I’ve been diagnosed for 6 years. I’ve tried so many different things, programs, therapists, have been hospitalized, etc and nothing has worked long term. The only way I’m not constantly triggered is if I stay home and do nothing. I can’t just do that because I have a job and a life. That being said, I’ve learned to live with anorexia. After my second recovery attempt (I’ve had 4 attempts) I decided to not cut out different kinds of foods anymore and just restrict when my brain felt I needed to. So in this way I’m still able to eat with people, go out for meals, not stress about ingredients, etc. I also don’t fast anymore so even when I’m restricting I eat 3 meals a day, even if it’s the smallest portion. So during the day I’m able to somewhat have energy to work and socialize. I don’t like to think that I’m “giving up” ever recovering, but it really really isn’t working for me. I was also diagnosed with afrid when I was 10, so I really don’t think I could ever see a life without an eating disorder. I hate to think this way but does anyone else feel like this? Like Im just at a point where I need to learn to live with it. Any thoughts?",15phwdc,26,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15phwdc/when_do_u_give_up/,AnorexiaNervosa

1451,Anorexia and addiction,"I've struggled with addictions to weed and more recently stimulants for the last 3 years. On my last binge I fainted and pulled a muscle because I hadn't eaten. I'm 40 days sober but lots of bad feelings are coming to the surface. 

The more I deconstruct my relationship with drugs I realize it's almost entirely related to my disdain for eating. It was there in high school, but wasn't truly an issue until I got older. 

I feel sick everytime I eat, like it kills all my energy and momentum. When I finally get so weak I have to eat, it feels like I can't do anything. 

Close to a year ago I started working more and excercising less, and started gaining weight. I was already using stimulants but they weren't truly a problem until then. It's so dumb because it's only a few pounds, but if I can't see my ribcage I feel useless. I'm scared if I gain anything people will notice. 

It feels so inescapable, whether it's the weight gain, the way it grounds me, just the feeling. If I stop using drugs I have to eat, if I stop eating I have to use drugs (which feels better but hurts me). 

I really don't express these feelings to anyone. I don't judge anyone else as harshly as I judge myself and I don't want them to think that I am. There's something that feels weak in admitting that food is my biggest enemy, especially when they know my issues with substance abuse. It almost feels more embarrassing. 

Even going back as far as High School, it feels like the clean feeling from not eating is the original high. I want to feel like that all the time. And at this point, it's like I don't remember what healthy feels like.

i was so constipated my stomach stuck out the front of the jacket and i had a breakdown (well a few) and i also realised that day i dont suit pink. (which is also bad it was expensive) and i cried then went out for dinner. 

not sure of others get this but after an experience like that i steer clear of that outfit because it makes me feel fat if i wear it. (again idk if its body dysmorphia) 

this is just going to sound bratty but i dont want to wear it again because i hate the way i feel in it and it just ruins my mood.

1457,Why I finally chose recovery,"So this is something I could write so much about but I’ll say it briefly: I chose my recovery because of my deteriorating health. I realised I do NOT want to d*e. All this time I thought I was the exception, that my ED couldn’t possibly hurt me so bad, but it did and it has.

I became so frustrated when I found out I’m anaemic, have low immunity, possible PCOS, terrible mood swings, and worst of all: Amenorrhea. I got sick of waiting for my period to come, waiting for the pills to work, just waiting for my body to function the way it did before.

Being skinny is so not worth it. I don’t want to be skinny if it means feeling dizzy at times and not having a healthy brain. I’m done hurting my body and treating it like shit when it has done nothing but support me and keep me alive.

I’m choosing recovery for myself and for my body, and for my family who watched me suffer. I really hope I win this time 💕💕

Please know you are not alone and you are not the exception. It doesn’t take long for your ED to go south and completely wreck your body and your life.

1473,Feel like I don’t belong in residential,"Don’t know if this will be taken down soon but in the past 2 months my disorder, routines, and obsessive behavior regarding my disorder has practically taken over my life and I was persuaded by my family and friends to be admitted to a residential treatment center. It took a lot out of me to accept that I need professional help, that I will most definitely need to gain to recover, and that I would be consuming more food in treatment than I do at home. 
I’m going on to my third day of the program and I’m starting to feel like I don’t belong here. The amount of food they’re feeding me is quite ridiculous and tbh less than I consume at home. Normally, my intake was little to nothing during the day and then all of what I allowed myself to eat at night so I guess you could say I definitely volume ate. Here, I’m being served less food with more nutrition. For example todays breakfast was 1 French toast stick, half a yoplait yogurt, water. Lunch was half a cheese sandwich and a handful of grapes with water. dinner was about 12 pieces of penne with oil and peas with water. They don’t have me participate in morning snack like others and only have me eat 1 other half portion snack at night which is like a graham cracker w peanut butter. I feel like because I’m not struggling to finish the single French toast stick they give me, I’m not sick enough to be here. The other new girls are refusing mostly all of it. It makes me severely uncomfortable to sit next to a girl who’s smaller than me who refuses to eat a bite of food while I’m here feeling gross and invalid because I might want to finish my whole 12 pieces of pasta after all day long of baby snacks lol. I don’t know if it’s because I came in here fully prepared and ready to “recover” and eat food that made me uncomfortable. But it seems to be extremely small quantities for lots of cals. And although the surplus of cals is making me uncomfortable, I feel like I’m not being challenged like I should be because in the real world, I think people are eating more than this. I honestly think a toddler is eating more than this. Again, it might be the volume eating thing that’s getting to me because usually I starve all day and only look forward to my giant salad at night. 
They told me that I do need to put on weight in order to recover at my meeting today so I know that they at least think I should be here.",15nwwhc,16,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15nwwhc/feel_like_i_dont_belong_in_residential/,AnorexiaNervosa

1480,Long term damage is catching up to me and I'm at a loss,"*tw for mentions of death, hospitalization, symptoms talked about, and especially tw for mentions of death from this disorder*

I don't want to get better, but I don't want to be a cautionary tale of what this does to people. I'm tired of crying on the floor because I ate ""too much"" and disassociating. I don't think I'm at risk of passing away from this,  sometimes I'm scared my body will give out from the repeated abuse and neglect. I don't want to worry my people, I don't want to end up like that. 

I'm going to spare the details that aren't relevant. I developed disordered eating at 7y/o, and that transitioned to anorexia norvosa at 12. 3 years later I physically recovered (weight restored at 15). Three more bouts over the past 6 years, I've spent 1.5 years of that time trying to recover. Currently I'm in the trenches with it. 

I'm 24 now, and I'm afraid after destroying my organs, starving my thinkin meat, and making myself miserable for so many years this is when my  body will give out. 
I know how shitty i felt before. It's different this time for me. I went through rapid weightloss May-now. I didn't mean to loss it first. my ex and I had broke up. I felt out of control and yall know how detrimental control can be. 

I'm at the worst I've ever been. I can't eat in front of people, I stand in front of the mirror up to an hour at a time sometimes just poking and pinching and scrutinizing myself. I'm obsessed with myself in the worst way. I cancel plans, I'm isolated. Out of fear. It's awful every time people see me when they haven't recently. The look of shock, concern, and sometimes jealousy shakes me to my core. Idk how much I'd weigh if I got on a scale but I refuse that because it'll make it worse. 

My physical state is what I'm worried about most. Bradycardia has returned full force. I see black when I stand up, my blood pressure is in the toilet. I stumble, trip and honestly I do fall occasionally. The shower is the worst for that. I know these are common symptoms, but they're getting dangerous. I lose vision (idk if that's directly related tbh, my eyes refuse to focus randomly). Memory loss, chronically feeling flu like, with hair loss. There are so many little symptoms that I can't list them. (The usual purple nails, poor circulation, cold all the time etc) 

Everyone knows I'm not okay, nobody has said anything besides my ex. We're on good terms thankfully, and she almost cried when we spent time together after breaking up. She blames herself for my relapse but that isn't the case. Anything would of pushed me regardless. It's hard for her, she's never seen me like this. 
When we hug I feel her hand go down my spine, trying to tell how bad it's getting. No other partner I've had cared like she does. Lots of love and support for each other now, she's my safest person. We don't speak right now, nothing bad happened though. 

Towards the folks who have been through this stage of disorder please be honest. Give it to me raw. Im also hesistant because it can be triggering to tapk about, but if anyone knows someone who passed from an ED would you be willing to share their story? Not every detail of course.  I need a reality check of how this ends when you don't recover. 

(I'm aware of the statistics. I know the numbers and percentages. I read the DSM5 several times for these disorders, I can read all the facts. But we all know its also skewed because you have to meet the disorder BMI cut off for AN. People are turned away from treatment and are told ""come back when you're sicker"" while they can be at risk of death or a medical emergency regardless of weight. There's more to learn about EDs, and hopefully we get a glimmer of what's going on within us. And the support and treatments we need)",15nfs9a,9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15nfs9a/long_term_damage_is_catching_up_to_me_and_im_at_a/,AnorexiaNervosa

first of all here's some context: I have been living with anorexia for  quite a few years but was only diagnosed around three years ago when I was  already at end stage. I then had to gain enough weight to go back to school however I have lost quite a bit since then. I'm still underweight but am not comfortable  with gaining any more.

I'm extremely sensitive to triggers and really struggle with comparing myself to others - if I see anyone that I view as ""competition"" it affects me really severely and continues to do so for days. For example, last night I stumbled upon some Eugenia Cooney content and I'm finding it extremely difficult to  function.

1486,Anyone else disabled/ chronically ill?,"(Cross posted)
Is anyone else disabled/chronically ill?
I'm a full time wheelchair user. I get really jealous of others who can walk etc, because the only way I can loose weight is by restricting, whereas others can walk etc to help with weight loss. Also, due to the fact that I'm in a wheelchair, my TDEE etc is a heck of a lot lower than others, which means I have to restrict even lower than others.
I'm also currently on the verge of being admitted to inpatient (it will be happening sooner rather than later), but due to the fact that I'm disabled and that a lot of E.D units aren't wheelchair accessible etc, I will be having to go further from home compared to an able bodied person who doesn't need accessible facilities etc.
I just feel alone - it's lonely enough dealing with anorexia, let alone being disabled as well.

I’m not sure what my ed could be classified as: it started as diet and exercise now it’s skipping meals, avoiding food, binging and vomiting, sometimes I chew food and spit it out.
I already had episodes in the past and I now how bad it can get. It’s been pretty recent that it came back so strong and I have dysmorphia so that adds to the struggle.
I don’t really want to stop right now.

My question is:
I have to leave for a holiday in a week with a bunch of people (some friends and other I’m not that close to), we are a group of 10.
How do I handle all my habits (like not having lunch). And I’m worried they will cook fat foods so I will be eating two bites and making excuses?
I’m not sure.
And maybe they will see right throw me and start judging or making comments or lectures.
I might have to be a great faker and make people not realize this will actually be a struggle for me.

I already know I won’t be enjoying myself because I will be focusing on food all the time.
I don’t really now what I am asking here. Probably a lot of people had it bad and had a rough recovery but maybe some are in this situation I am in or can remember how it feels like.

1505,Looking for people’s perspectives on my recovery/ED support therapist,"I’ve recently started seeing a therapist for my ED but I’m not quite sure if we’re on the same page tbh. I’ve been through many attempts at recovering from my ED or even just reducing my amount of restriction to a point where I can kinda get “stable” and eat enough to sustain myself without feeling like I’m spiralling all day every day, for 11 years. I’ve been restricting for 14 years (over half my life). I’ve had periods where I’ve been more stable but the past year & a half it keeps getting increasingly worse so I need professional support.

I’ve recently decided that I want to try to make some changes to my behaviour, idk if full recovery is in the cards for me but that’s a future me-problem to figure out. I’ve found an *AMAZING* ED specialist dietitian and I feel like we are completely on the same page and she’s really working with me starting from harm reduction and making small changes very slowly. I get really triggered by anyone discussing me “getting better” or “recovering”/“being in recovery” so this has been so so so helpful to take a step back and do this at my own pace.

I have been in therapy for 12 years. I know what works for me and what doesn’t. I was honest with this therapist 2 sessions ago that CBT really doesn’t work for me but it seems like she hasn’t really been able to shut that off. I knew that she primarily worked from a CBT lens but I was hoping that since she asked what kind of therapy style works for me and I told her that CBT doesn’t do anything for me, she would respect that. But she’s really been pushing me to try changing my thoughts and having me assess my thoughts. I assess my thoughts 24/7, I rationalize the fuck out of my life, I don’t need to analyze or focus on trying to change them to something “less distorted” or however you want to put it. But she still is hinting at using a CBT type approach or is at least just not on the same page as me. And she says she works a lot with EDs but I’m getting the sense that mine is more ingrained/entrenched/chronic than she is used to or not really understanding that I’m not at a “I WANT TO RECOVERY RN IM ALL IN” place rn. I’m also just not in a place where I’m ready to fully attack my thoughts and make it so I’m quickly able to get more comfortable and ready for recovery and I think that’s what she’s used to/her approach to getting people “into recovery.” 

I have tried bringing this stuff up but she kinda latches onto a thought I share rather than letting me expand on what I wanted talk about. 

I’m scared to find someone new esp bc I have limited financial resources = limited experienced options but I think I’m just ending the session being frustrated.

Im sure I don’t get hungry anymore at all, nor am I upset about it in the slightest. I drink a few coffees with plenty of heavy dairy and additions/sweeteners a day, and zero actual solid food. It has been this way for weeks now, and I genuinely cannot begin to eat food. The attention I would take from looks from people on the sidewalk feels irrelevant and shameful. I have no clue how to start, I have significant issues with subscribing to many of the published methods of eating disorder recovery, due to my case’s complications and additions. I too am a bulimic, so if any food actually gets consumed, I am *getting rid* of it, immediately. I am unsure how long I can actually avoid organ failure at this point. I am in near-zero position to even consider recovery, I am into my mid twenties and am facing the consequences of living like this for 6+ years. My teeth are rotting, I look pale and ghostly, it’s not attractive, in any capacity. Unsure of the ending of this tangent, just felt that I should speak that.

Mood wise, I have never been better, I'm free from bipolar episodes and I have no thoughts of ending my life, I'm genuinely happy, despite everything 

On the other hand... the anorexia is really bad, I've never eaten this little and been this sick. Doctor is threatening to hospitalise me... yeah ugh... Yet, since I'm not underweight nobody would ever guess that I'm anorexic, if anything they'd probably sooner guess i have binging issues...

And on yet another hand, my life is basically over, I'm unable to pursue my dreams in life and I'm kinda stuck, living in the middle of nowhere with no friends or real connections, with my only hope being that I can move with the help of the social system... eventually 

Yet... usually when people ask, I just say I'm great, because I'm genuinely happy

I'm probably a bit of a minority here... most anorexics I know seem to be horribly depressed pretty much all the time

1514,I gave an ex friend an ed,"Now to clarify, this was years ago and I didnt even fully find about this until today. 

So back when I was 16-17 I was in my peak honeymoon phase. Which is bad for many reasons but one of them was me not noticing a friend of mine (Who I will call R) is actually jealous of me for a long list of reasons. The starting one being a boy they liked asking them if I was single.

Little did I know R started copying my eating habits. I would notice them staring at me while I eat but that was common given it was well know by my friends at that point about my ed. While this made me wildly uncomfortable I would always brush it off because I thought they were just worried. Later on we dont talk anymore do to other reasons.

Now today, 3-4 years later. Im finding out that I am the direct cause of their eating disorder from a mutual friend of ours. I feel immense guilt and shame. I dont even know what to do with this information. While im not fond of this person. I never would want to put anyone through that. I just feel awful all around.

Edit: thank you for everyone’s responses, they made me feel much better about the situation and i appreciate it so much. I feel much less guilt now vs last night.

1518,How to seek help?,"
Hi, so this has taken a lot to write.. I’m always lurking on these subs feeling like I relate so much to the symptoms of anorexia. 
I am 23 don’t think technically I am underweight, but not far off. I gave birth to my son 9 months ago and what started off as a “weight loss journey” has quickly became something I don’t feel in control of. 

I read stories on here from people who are anorexic and weigh a lot less than me. And even though I relate to their symptoms, I don’t want to seek help and waste anybody’s time when I’m nowhere near that small. 

I lie to my family about what I’ve eaten, “I’ve already eaten” or “I’m sooo full” even if my stomach is grumbling. 

I count calories for everything. And always make sure it’s below a certain number, I even Googled how many calories are in toothpaste, and got scared to take my daily vitamins because it didn’t state if there was any calories in them. 

I find myself staring at myself in the mirror every day just pinching bits of me I want to disappear, and when I see my ribs sticking out a bit more, or my spine, I feel like I’ve accomplished something and it fuels me to keep going. 

My family have expressed concerns about how small I’m getting, but all I say is “ I have a baby I run around 24/7 and that’s why the weight is coming off “ I feel awful for using my child as a way to explain this away to people 😣 

When I do eat it’s extremely controlled, if someone gave me rice or pasta I would probably break down in tears because I wouldn’t be able to eat it, I substitute carbs for cauliflower rice. And tell my partner because it’s ‘healthier’. I’ll have this with a side of chicken, no sauce, I refuse to cook using oil because of the calories. 

I watch programmes like supersize vs super skinny just to get tips from the underweight people and implement this into my daily life

I could go on and on, I don’t know how to address this or even bring this up to anyone, but I’m quickly realising I may have a problem",15l9da6,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15l9da6/how_to_seek_help/,AnorexiaNervosa

I dk what my problem is (maybe I'm lazy) but like I have no desire to cook or make anything for myself if I do eat.

Note: when I do get something it could be anything from a salad to anything else. Not a binge (I don't do that). Just a meal. I don't always eat the whole thing. Today I did. I was proud of myself (kinda) and upset at myself).

My biggest thing like obsession lately as well has been smoothies (which for me is part of take out). Like Tropical Cafe smoothies. I discovered them more when I was at the eating disorder unit. And ever since then I get the same one as I did that day the RSS's took me there for a challenge. (RSS = Residential Supportive Staff).

1523,Advice please,"Mentions of food intake below, no calories etc mentioned. Mentions of purging after eating / drinking. 

I’m asking here because I’m really worried and I really don’t have anyone I can ask about this; I’m currently having my best friend live with me who has Anorexia with bulimic tendencies. I used to suffer from binge eating disorder in my early 20s and I’ve been helping her through her trying to improve her eating habits 

For the past 3 months she has been eating a semi regular diet with me, at least lunch and an evening meal with a tea before bed. Before she came to stay with me she was in a complete starvation period where she would just purge and take laxative, over exercise (running with heart palpitations) and have nausea and dizziness every day. I took her to see a therapist but she didn’t really engage with it; I had seen a therapist for my issues and this was helpful to me in terms of someone listening to me. We were going out and doing things, hiking, movies, meals out, beach days etc etc… I know that it’s complicated and has ups and downs but she was talking to me whenever she purged or was struggling. 

But the past week has been completely different. At first it was eating then purging within 2 hours (for the past 6 days) but now it’s not drinking either. The advice that I’m wanting is about the fluids… because I don’t have any experience with this and I’m desperate to hear from other people. She didn’t drink all day yesterday and drank one glass of water today and purged it after one hour. I’m really worried about whether she can survive without water??

Has anyone experienced??

Also I’m really sorry as I feel I shouldn’t be using this sub to ask advice about another person. I’m just struggling to figure out how to help (obviously if I saw something really worrying physically I would contact medical professionals but she’s an adult, late 20s so it’s more complicated)",15kyc3y,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15kyc3y/advice_please/,AnorexiaNervosa

I have anorexia binge purge type. I am severely underweight as in i should be on bedrest etc. I have tried to recover several times till i reached a healthy weight. 

My eating disorder is based on a trauma, ive been sexual abused several times, this is the reason why i fear a healthy body because i am affraid to get touched. The body i have now makes me feel safe because i dont look ""attractive"". 

So i am upset because ive been in group treatment and so far every of my groupmates are doing really well in recovery, as they say: i want my breasts and bootie back"" but they notice im not doing well in recovery and they are trying to push me, knowing i fear the female roundings because it triggers my trauma enormously. 

Anyway it annoys me a lot to hear every time how wonderful recovery is. Because thats bullshit for people who use the ED to erease the female bodyparts. To me gaining weight means im losing my shield which protects me from unwanted touches.

1546,"Weight gain, body dysmorphia and body dissatisfaction","I’ve been weight restored for a while now, about a year and a half.

My body weight fluctuated at the start, water weight, bloating, edema, body fat going to the ‘important’ places first…

But, I was happier, that I had a bum to sit on, that I could wear a dress and my legs not look like two sticks, that I looked ‘normal’

Now, I’ve lost weight again, training, and I am less happy, less happy with my body and myself. To a point where it is crippling and I cannot leave the house or find it very difficult to. Very difficult to put on clothes, see my body, constantly picking myself and how I look apart. 

I feel like I have ‘gained fat’ recently, apparently I am delusional and I’ve carried on losing but I CANNOT SEE IT. I just feel like i have gained. 

I am beyond unhappy with my body, not lean enough, not muscular enough, big in the wrong areas and small in others. Constantly finding reason to lose more weight because apparently that’s my solution to any dissatisfaction I have with myself.

Need help so I’m posting it here as well.

I’ve been struggling with Anorexia for almost 5 years now and I’ve had my highs and lows. During the summer is when things get pretty tough for me. Recently I’ve been obsessively counting calories and sugar. Now, I haven’t been restricting. I’m trying to gain weight as I’m under a healthy weight right now. However, I’m still counting. I’ve also been counting sugar, but what frightens me the most is that I feel as though I crave and eat too much sugar. For example, just this evening I’ve had (redacted amount) in candy and chocolate. This has been going on every day now. I’m worried that it’s going to get worse, that I won’t be able to handle my sugar “addiction”. But I’m torn between wanting to gain weight and not wanting to become overweight or diabetic because so many calories consumed are through sugar. I know this probably sounds dramatic, but I am really worried. And not even fruit (in any form) satisfies these cravings. Any help would be much appreciated.

1550,How soon can you die from anorexia?,"Hello. I relapsed into anorexia 2 months ago, but I've actually been undereating and losing weight for the last 5 months because of depression and stress. It triggered me to relapse into anorexia and I really don't want to recover right now. Gaining weight freaking terrifies me. I'm currently a little underweight. 

I've been restricting severely, but today I forced myself to eat a little more because I've been feeling like crap the last few days and was having some heart palpitations. And I was experiencing a lot of anxiety, thinking ""omg I'm gonna die"". But like I said, I don't want to recover right now. So I'm gonna go back to restricting tomorrow. 

I know the health consequences of anorexia because I've researched it and I've been to the ER for it. Not recently. It was years ago.

How soon can a person die from anorexia? A few months? A year? Longer?

1561,A poem about Anorexia,"So I’m hoping you guys will appreciate this poem. I write poetry a lot and I find it really healing so I thought I would share one I recently wrote. I’ve been trying to recover from this ed for awhile now so if anyone is where I’m at in this journey also, I hope this helps. 

(title) Enemy number one: Food 

She comes into your life disguised as a friend, 
Promises of self love and worth and comfort and 
“Let’s just pretend.” 
She says, 
as she creeps into the cracks and
feasts on your soul 
Let’s you nibble on the illusion
Lets you think you have control
She decorates your skin with the sharp edges of your bones, 
Says, “We’re going into battle. Let’s carve your gravestone.” 
Anorexia is a glutton, haven’t you heard the stories?
She gorges herself on the meat from our bodies
Makes pretty desserts from the thoughts in our heads
Says, “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. You’ll feel better when you’re dead.” 
Anorexia is a con artist, don’t you see it dear? 
She lured us in with peaceful whispers in our ears
Starved us and sized us, for the smallest coffin possible 
Said, “Don’t worry, don’t panic. You’ll be alright. I’m right here.” 
I’ve asked for help you know. 
If you would’ve listened closely,
“No thank you.” 
“I’m stuffed.” 
“I’ll eat later” 
“I’m not hungry.”",15iaw9w,17,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15iaw9w/a_poem_about_anorexia/,AnorexiaNervosa

When I was evaluated for an out patient program, they told me I wasn’t even allowed to go on short walks. 
So i haven’t done much exercise since april (when i started recovery) i’ve just been eating and trying to feel better, which I do, but now i miss movement. like A LOT, but i’m worried that it will just trigger my ed or something. i need it to be positive bc exercise used to be a way for me to release stress. I’m also nervous about starting up activity after a long pause because it’s very daunting. 
so here’s my question: how do i know i’m ready to go back? 
and what exercises/workouts do you recommend? my mom wants to start lifting and not doing cardio anymore (which is what i used to do). i have fitness goals do build/define my core and glutes. any tips? what should i eat/how much/when should i eat before the gym?

So I’ve had ARFID all my life but I’ve been experiencing bad anorexia for the last 2 years ish? I was very overweight and lost that weight to the point where my therapist now says I’m underweight but only slightly. I went into treatment for my ED in January I think? But because of my ARFID it make it hard to eat anyway. 
Anyway, the main point, I have been passing out since last November and it’s not too often but maybe like once or twice a month. I think it’s due to low blood sugar but I’m not sure? I can feel my body start to shut down and it gets really hard to breathe. Everything goes blurry and I can only do or think one thing at a time. I don’t know how to explain it very well but all the things your body does on it’s own like breathing and that just becomes manual. I have to force myself to breathe and it feels like I don’t know how to. I also can’t talk or move it just feels like my brain and body are separate and everything is slow. I am usual conscious whilst this happens but I can’t move or see much and it just gets worse till I pass out completely which luckily hasn’t happened much. It’s is honestly terrifying and I genuinely think I’m gonna die every time it happens. I used to come out of these episodes in shock and scream and cry but I think I’m used to it now and can hold it in. Now you probably think why don’t you just eat? I do that’s the problem. It started when I didn’t eat which was understandable but now I do eat and it’s still happening. I’m worried that if I pass out again I won’t wake up and have asked the ambulance to be called just before I pass out whilst I can still talk. But, I live with my parents still, my mum doesn’t want too she says they will keep me in hospital which I’d be ok with if this stopped. But she said they will also take my driving licence, I can drive ok and these episodes are something I feel coming so I wouldn’t drive if I felt bad. I’ve seen diabetics carry juice with them so I do that too now just in case. College is the only reason my other mental health problems haves took me out yet and I need my licence to get there. But this passing out stuff if so scary and I can’t do anything but sit inside my own body when it happens. I hate it and I want it to stop but I don’t know what to do. The doctors did my bloods and ecg back in January and other that being anaemic I was ok. So I don’t know if I actually need any help all I know is that I don’t usually get scared if this stuff but the feeling of not waking up is not feeling very fun right now. Especially when my mum is right there and I can’t even tell her I love her.

I’ve been bleeding for 11 days now, so I’m really wondering is it because of that? Like period bloating? Or is it more likely to just be anxiety fueled dysmorphia? 

If it is bloating, will it go away when I get through the break through period? Please, if anyone has experience or knowledge on this let me know, I’m really really struggling with it.",15hpd92,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15hpd92/birth_control_related_bloating/,AnorexiaNervosa

1582,How do I do it?,"I've had issues with food pretty much my whole life, earliest I can remember is elementary school. It kicked up around covid, I binged quite a bit, and hardly ate any real meals. When I went back to school in person, I got really insecure, and I had some disordered eating behaviors. However, what really triggered it was when I started going to a new school, I had a group of friends, 2 of which were very blatantly pro ana. I downloaded tracking and fasting apps, I repeated those dumbass proana bullshit slogans like a mantra. I kind of drifted away from it after a while, but I fell back into it. I would ""forget"" to eat all day, and only eat dinner. sometimes I wouldn't even do that. And now, I've conditioned myself so much that I can hardly ever finish a meal. I've noticed more hair than usual coming out in the shower and when I brush, and I'm almost certain it feels thinner. I've been trying to eat more nutritious and full meals, but when I get to a certain point, it becomes hard to chew and swallow, I go from enjoying it, to just going through the motions and forcing it down. I hate the empty feeling I get when my body is screaming at me to give it food, and when I try, it's like my brain does anything it can to stop me. It also doesn't help that I have adhd and take meds, because no matter what, there is not 1 adhd medication that doesn't cause appetite suppression. I just want to be normal. I just want to be able to eat 3 full, nutritious meals a day.",15hkf6h,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15hkf6h/how_do_i_do_it/,AnorexiaNervosa

1589,How to start recovery,"Hi, I have never really done this before so please bear with me. My anorexia started in 2017, when I was 16. I was dating someone that completely destroyed me mentally. He would say horrible things about my body to others in front of me for one small example. I’ve never been overweight. I was with him for three years before getting into another poor relationship (I’m the kind of person that attaches to others very easily if I’m given any form of attention due to childhood neglect) and that worsened it for me. Now, I’m in a healthy relationship with a different man, and I was doing really well for the first few months and I’ve been declining ever since. During the first boyfriend, I ended up losing quite a bit of weight in two months. Right now I’m at my lowest and I’m terrified. I’ve never been that low before and I don’t know what to do. I’m living paycheck to paycheck, so a therapy bill is out of my range, but I have gone before. Right now I can’t eat more than maybe a cup sized of food a day without feeling sick. People are constantly telling me to eat more, but I physically can’t. Calories never bothered me, I’m not worried about that. I just can’t eat no matter how hard I try. What are some ways that helps? I know I can eat calorie dense food, but then again, I can only eat so much without feeling the need to throw up. I don’t make myself throw up either, it’s just the feeling that if I eat any more, my stomach will burst and I get really sick. Can I have any tips? Please?

1599,Just a little story time and encouragement for you to get out of a negative environment if you can.,"So when I first moved to a new state, i worked at a coffee shop and being the very very social person I am I immediately started talking to everyone. To my surprise, all of my coworkers were younger girls and waaaay more serious and blunt than I could ever be. I'm very loud and very talkative and I annoyed the living hell out of everyone, but at first I didn't care because I'll always be myself and not apologize for it. I love my humor and I love my empathy and if someone doesn't, that's okay! It started to get really vicious and I walked past each of them talking about me several times. It got to the point where even my body was talked about. I heard two shift supervisors saying 'god, for someone so skinny she's always in the way' and 'does she ever shut up? Let's just keep her on window the whole shift so she can annoy them not us' 

This was during my worst relapse and these words truly sent me spiriling because I was actually hearing the words I would say to myself, out loud. My mental illness because reality and I kinda of... Didn't want to be around anymore. 
I started restricting harder which caused my brain fog to be at hazardless levels. Like if it were the weather, there'd be a do not drive advisory. 

My coworkers then started calling me dumb, too slow to do anything and 'I don't even know what position to out you in because you can't do anything. It's like you are just coming to earth for the first time'

Everything they said cut like a knife. 
I worked there for a year before realizing I was going to die physically as well as mentally if I did not leave. 

Once I quit I still struggled immensely and their words still played in my head like a broken record. But it wasn't long until those voices quited. My brain gave up playing the same song on repeat because it played so much I stopped caring. It's been about 3 months and I've already started weight restoring and being more active and present. 

So. If this story resonates with you and you're in a toxic environment. Please leave if possible. It will only drive the ED faster than before.

Well now I'm I relapse. But while my doctor who's her doctor as well, is telling me not to worry and getting me the help I need, she's scares for me based on diet culture.
I'm already barely eating. Some days I don't even have a meal. Some days it's skipping meals. Some days it's grazing. But to outsiders and sadly even my own mother, it looks like I'm binging when I'm doing the opposite. It makes it hard to want to recover. She doesn't understand that too much exercise can be a form of purging. My doctor only allows me 20 min of walking a day. Add to that the walking I do because I'm a mom of 4.

1603,Dose it ever stop?,"I've battled anorexia Since I can remember, no matter how much I weigh, I've always been called fat. I began my recovery last year when I joined a rehabilitation programme and began attending group therapy. I joined because I was constantly ill, had trouble sleeping, and couldn't even afford to eat.

Nobody knows about my anorexia, at least I’ve never admitted to anyone about it. My weight never got bad enough for anyone to notice. At one time, my mother had a suspicion, but I simply denied it, and she went on. Even my therapist is unaware. Maybe it's just my toxic masculinity, but I figured I could handle it on my own.

my significant other keeps an eye on my diet, always worries if I’m eating enough. He’s into feeding fetishes but he wouldn’t force me to over eat or nothing like that but he does give me a significant amount of attention if I do over eat so naturally I started binge eating without noticing, until recently. I keep sweating, I’m out of breath and In generally just feel gross. I also started HRT (hormone replacement therapy) which made me gain even more weight. Now I’ve gained over 30kg, it makes me feel awful, most of my favourite clothes don’t fit me anymore. 

I try to work out 3 times a week but I just can’t stop eating junk food. If I have a bad day or a stressful day I result to take out immediately. I don’t know what to do anymore. I want this to stop. it got me thinking about anorexia in general. Last night my sister showed me old videos of myself when I was balls deep into anorexia and I was so so little but I remember thinking that I was so big. I always feel big. No matter what. Does it ever stop? 

I give up on diets because of this, then I end up regretting it immediately. My family also keeps pointing out my weight gain, they always say it’s in a good way but I don’t hear it in a good way. It makes me feel even worse.

I feel so embarrassed. I’ve even began thinking about going back to starving myself again but it’s literally not possible for me anymore. How do I even lose weight in my situation???",15fqien,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15fqien/dose_it_ever_stop/,AnorexiaNervosa
1604,How do I support a romantic partner who recently opened up about their Anorexia,"Hey friends, my S.O. opened up about their recent and significant struggles with anorexia. I went home and researched E.D. and how to be supportive and helpful while the road to recovery is being paved, but I'm hoping to hear some insight from the community. 

I've come to learn that generally speaking I can't necessarily ""help"" with the E.D. but I want to be as supportive and understanding as I can so they feel comfortable talking to me about it. I recently learned a good bit but I feel like the broad strokes I've learned aren't necessarily as helpful in the moment. 

For example: in the past if they said they were having a bad body image day, I would respond with assurance they are beautiful or something along those lines because I didn't really understand what they meant and the harm those sentiments have in that moment. Although that's just one example, I hope it is kind of a launching point for a discussion on how to be the support system someone needs as they navigate the difficult situation.

1610,New to this,"I have just recently realized I have true anorexia nervosa and not physically induced anorexia. I had cancer 3 years ago that made me gain a ton of weight a long with a double mastectomy that came with it’s own body image issues. I subconsciously stopped eating about 18 months ago. I didn’t notice any results and so it became more severe as time progressed. I had to get a blood transfusion last fall and have to use a shower chair now as I faint in the shower if I stand. I really didn’t see any weight fluctuations for the first year of not eating but I have lost 25% of my body weight in the past 6 months. I’ve just recently accepted this is AN and started going to therapy but I feel like I have more work that needs done than an hour per week can provide. I also don’t know how severe of symptoms require inpatient work versus outpatient. My state has no inpatient centers so I would either have to do virtual or fully commit and travel out of state. I am honestly just terrified to start the recovery process as I don’t want to gain weight. I was strictly getting intake from energy drinks and no solid foods, and now can eat a little solids but not much. Eating also makes me nauseous now so it’s hard to keep food down even if I mentally allow myself to eat. I just feel like such a shell of a human lately due to malnutrition symptoms especially brain fog, and social isolation. Has anyone found hope in the first stages of recovery and have any advice for those just reaching the acceptance phase? Im in my twenties but somehow feel like I’m 65 lately, I just feel like I can’t keep up with life.

1611,Australia's public health system is terrible,"TW: physical violence

Need to vent on behalf of my sister with an ed. She is in a public hospital currently, and they treat her so awfully. She is already traumatised by the public health system. The nurses and doctors have ignored my sister's pleas for help, as she hasn't been able to excrete or urinate in two days. Instead of listening to her, the medical staff have yelled at her, blamed her ed for her pains, had security men manhandle her, PULL DOWN HER PANTS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WARD, and sedated her. I feel so awful that this is how ed's are being treated in Australia. I am disgusted, and angry as hell.

I truly feel for each and every one of you. ED's are so rarely understood, and it is enraging that so many ""medical professionals"" treat a nuanced and complex disorder with such blatant disregard for your emotional and mental well-being. Sending you all my love and strength.",15f34aw,9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15f34aw/australias_public_health_system_is_terrible/,AnorexiaNervosa
1612,Too scared to eat enough to maintain weight. Help,"Hello. I was in recovery for 2 years, but recently lost a lot of weight.  Most of it was unintentional, but it triggered a relapse and now I'm super scared to eat enough again. 

I need to stop losing weight because my older brother (who I live with) keeps telling me he's going to send me back to the mental hospital if I keep losing weight. He wants me to gain weight. 

I don't want to gain. That terrifies me. I just want to maintain my current weight to hopefully stay out of the hospital, but I have no idea how... I've been trying to eat enough to maintain, but I keep failing. So my weight is continuing to go down... 

I'm just terrified I'll accidentally eat too many calories and gain weight. And I can't seem to bring myself to eat over a certain amount of calories, even though I know my weight will continue to go down on that amount.

Food is giving me a lot of anxiety right now. I'm just terrified of gaining weight and looking fat. And I just got to this weight. I'm underweight again and I don't want to gain weight right now. I don't even look underweight. Logically, I know I look skinny. But not underweight skinny. I love looking skinny and I think I look prettier at this weight. It's super tempting for me to lose even more weight. 

My brother doesn't know I'm underweight. I've been lying to him about how much I weigh. If he knew, he would send me to the hospital. He does sometimes force me on the scale so he can see for himself how much I weigh, but I have a plan to trick the scale for next time he does it.

I don't know what to ask. I guess I just want advice on how to maintain so I don't get sent to the hospital.

Thanks

1618,Nausea in early ana recovery,"Hello, I am 1 month into my anorexia recovery. I just have reintroduced eating meals the last month and everything has been pretty smooth on the physical side of things. Until yesterday morning after breakfast I got hit with extreme nausea and loss of appetite that lasted about an hour. It went away for the most part and I tried snacking on just some fruit, yet again was hit with extreme nausea. And then again when I tried eating later last night. I hoped I just had a bad day considering I’ve been in a depressive episode with loads of anxiety. But then today, about 15 minutes after breakfast I got hit with that same nausea but this time more severe. This is really discouraging and really really triggering :/ I just started building trust again for food and this is making me think it’s gonna lead to a relapse.

My problem is, after i eat, i genuinely get scared on how fat i will look after. Like, my sister can eat an entire dinner and look the same, but she has the same kind of body shape as me (belly wise) and its so confusing?? 
 
Lets say i have a full glass of water, im bloated for the next 3 hours, feel sick, and have water coming up if i lie down and don’t want to eat because i feel nauseous.

1623,i never used to be socially awkward,"now after a real dumpster-fire of a couple of years, i've lost a part of me, i'm certain of it. I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted, on top of the fatigue i get from not eating or from purging. It was my bday and my grandma jokingly asked me if I felt any older, and i replied with a monotone ""yea, i do feel older"" and then changed the subject because i feel like life is passing me by. A neighbour gave me a gift of chocolate for my bday and jokingly said ""looks like you could use the calories!"" and i just said ""yea..."" and then excused myself and went to my room. I just care less and less about how i behave around others now, if i reply to a text or not, so much of my life now is just escape and calories, tuning out, over exercising, restricting, bingeing, purging, isolating. I just give less and less fucks and there are less and less days where i feel like getting better. Nothing i do seems to matter. I've had severe fear of failure for my whole life and the past couple of years have burned out and now i have fear of success as well, that if i rise up and am successful again, i'll just fail and fall that much harder, in everything, job, health, relationship, etc, etc,, etc. Everyone is doing a better job than me or learning from their mistakes better than me.

My ED is like my closest friend, always there, one thing that's in my control, and that's mine. And there's a voice saying this friend will clearly betray you, but more and more it's like i'm just watching from outside my body as i continue to just do this shit anyways. If you've read this, thank you, i have nowhere else to vent this, i don't belong anywhere, i can't tell my therapist although i don't think he buys all my excuses for my weight loss... my situation feels like I'm a mouse on a treadmill with a furnace behind me and plexiglass in front of me, with a life worth living on the other side.

1624,Had some random stranger call me fat on the street,"Basically title. After a long long day of my partner gently encouraging me to each something all day I finally caved and let myself order some food from a nearby restaurant that sells food I feel safe eating. I was even going to get myself some ice cream from an ice cream food truck that usually parks right by the restaurant as a treat for overcoming my negative thoughts. The walk from my apartment is maximum 3 minutes, it’s literally two blocks away. At the first light, my partner and I notice someone across the street who is clearly having some sort of episode, they were talking to themselves and yelled at a passing car. We’re not looking in her direction and were prepared to just cross the street and move on. I don’t know what I did to encourage her attention, but for some reason she locked onto me and was making fun of the way I was leaning to wait for the green light to walk. She starts walking past us and starts immediately yelling at me. She immediately goes “I’m fucking ** pounds bitch! You’re a hell of a lot more than that”, “I don’t see a woman here I see two men and one of them is ugly as hell”, among many other things. She kept making fun of my weight and calling me ugly. One of the cars driving past us honks and rolls down his window and encourages her by saying “Yeah babe you tell her!!”. Then, when she was close enough, she tried to spit on me. As she was walking closer to me and was just about to pass us both, she says “what the fuck does your fucking shirt say anyway”. I was wearing this dumb old pajama shirt that has the name of one of the gyms that I used to go to that says “fit for life” on it along with the name of the gym. As she’s walking past she snickers and scoffs and goes “well THAT’S a fucking lie”. Something about this shirt triggered her enough that she decided to make a U-Turn and follow us and continues shaking me and my body and calling me ugly. We didn’t notice she was following us until another car stopped at a red light trying to turn right rolled down his window to warn us. That’s when I turned around and looked right at her and turned around again. I didn’t say anything, but suddenly she just stopped and just started walking in the other direction. 

I’m just really hurt. I’ve been on a road to letting myself eat more and more and I know that it is making me gain weight. I’ve been having a hard time accepting that clothes that used to be baggy on me fit and are even a bit tight now. It’s been a hard mental battle and everyone around me has been encouraging me that I don’t look overweight, and that is was just real weight I needed to gain for my health. I just feel discouraged because in my mind, clearly that’s not true if this random stranger’s first thought upon seeing me is to comment on my weight. I’ve spent the rest of the day letting my meal rest in the fridge just mentally battling my toxic thoughts again. 

I’m tired of not feeling safe eating food anymore. When it’s not my brain berating me, it’s a random stranger on the street.",15e4ic8,81,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15e4ic8/had_some_random_stranger_call_me_fat_on_the_street/,AnorexiaNervosa

I average 50 a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It has reached that point where I cannot go up a flight of stairs without gasping for breath, without my legs feeling like they're on fire. I'm seeing my GP on Thursday. I'm going to be as honest as I can about all the physical symptoms I'm experiencing despite extreme reservations. Contrary to my actions, I don't want to die, and I want to construct a future but the more I think about it the more anxious I become and the behaviours become worse. 

Last year I was sectioned (for the upteenth time) because of this. And yet, even though it was really bad then, this is the worst I've ever felt.

I will try to do these somewhat commonly, perhaps once or twice a week. Later, I'll get on my computer and schedule a bunch of them in advance. 

Now, what is this event about? Today, let's share our favourite mental health motivation-related quotes and sayings. You can share them in the form of quotes or images and everything goes, as long as all the subreddit rules are upheld. 

I'll go first:
I know it's cliché, but I've always loved the ""Rceovery isn't linear"" saying. I also love all of The Latest Kate(Instagram)'s little mental health animal drawings. I think they're adorable and a great, cute way of spreading positivity. 

If you don't know how to share an image in a comment, then you can add it as an imgur link! Just saying quotes/sayings is completely acceptable as well. 

I hope we're able to have some fun with this event! If you have any suggestions for ones in the future, please comment them or modmail them to us.

Snap it in half and share i guess but it’s literally taken me two weeks to get through this single bar of chocolate. I don’t understand the share bar thing cause aero has always been this size 🤷‍♀️ but despite it having taken so long to eat it i read that and was like ‘fat pig you’re eating for two’ 


Also off topic, i dont read the nutrition info on the back of any of my daughters food cause everything i can do to not let this seep into her life ill do it, but stupidly i did earlier when i was making one of her frozen meals and i hate myself for being jealous that she can eat that and its fine but if i get my own and eat them my bf and sister will give me so much shit but they’re yummy meals that are toddler size portions and LOW CALS I WANT TO SCREAM I JUST WISH I WAS NORMAL",15dhhxw,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15dhhxw/tw_cause_its_specific_about_my_snack_and_an/,AnorexiaNervosa
1642,picky eating as a child?,"since before i can remember, before i had anorexia, i was an extremely picky eater.  sometimes i wonder if the fact that i always had issues with food, started my anorexia. when i was YOUNG (3/4 years old) and forward, i never ate fruits, vegetables, spices, sauces, fish, anything with a mushy or dry texture, colored green and stuff like that. and if i did, i’d throw up unwillingly. i hated basically anything that wasn’t chicken nuggets, french fries or certain desserts. at that young age, i obviously didn’t mean it in the restrictive way, but it was an issue. i was always relatively skinny growing up, even with all the junk i ate (since i wouldn’t dare eat any healthy food) but, when i hit puberty i guess the body changes and weight gain hit me all at once. my ed was triggered whenever i felt sad, and it was my coping mechanism. a way to feel numb. also, i have ocd, so i guess it was the control that came with it. i just wonder if the picky eating as a child (the arfid and un-willingly throwing up) contributed to my later anorexia.",15ded6z,25,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15ded6z/picky_eating_as_a_child/,AnorexiaNervosa

1646,forced recovery is triggering my depression,"a few weeks ago i started going to a partial hospitalization program (php) for recovery due to my mom and the medical team's recommendation.

i hate it. i hate every second i spend there. i hate that i'm gaining weight, i hate that my body is getting used to eating this much food, i hate myself. i can't stand to look at myself in the mirror and feel disgusted. i can't put on my nice clothes because i feel way too insecure.

the treatment team there is trying to help me, but honestly it's not doing anything. tbh i don't want to recover. even when i was at my peak of my ed i was physically and mentally doing just fine. so i just don't see the need to recover. i felt way more confident and prettier, so why do i need to recover if that means i'm going to be depressed and be in self-hatred?

i know my depression is getting worse bc i haven't been having enough energy for hygiene and sleep every night for 11 hours or more (these have been red flags for me in the past multiple times). i just don't know what to do. all i want to do is go back to my old weight and feel pretty and happy.",15d9mf4,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15d9mf4/forced_recovery_is_triggering_my_depression/,AnorexiaNervosa

1654,Has this happened to anyone before? What do I do?," Deleted my crosspost to try posting this fresh instead so maybe more people will read it <3

TLDR-   Is one week of high res enough to throw my body out of wack? I  relapsed for a week and I'm trying to re-up my intake and now I'm  feeling sick. I don't know what to do. I'm coming here to ask for help  because no one else would understand these circumstances.

I've  been doing REALLY well with recovery for a while, but I had a bit of a  lapse and started restricting again for the past 7 days. I've had a  headache and shaky hands nonstop, and the feeling is so addictive. It's  hard to stop this cycle again now that I'm back in it.

My  therapist is helping with harm reduction while I try to pull out of  this lapse. I'm trying not to eat under BMR. But, I'm also not tracking  with an app, just estimating, so I don't actually know how hard I've  been restricting. I just know that I cut my intake by a pretty  significant amount.

I tried eating  closer to my normal amount last night, and had a snack before bed. I  woke up so nauseous today and had to call out of work. Today I have been  trying to keep up with the higher (aka normal) intake and I feel awful.  I'm nauseous, anxious, and feeling really overheated even with an ice  pack on my neck. The symptoms are far from unbearable, I'm just chilling  on the couch, but I definitely don't feel okay.

Has  this happened to anyone else? I know people on reddit are not doctors,  but members of this sub would probably be better-positioned to answer  this question than my GP.

Is there anything I can do for these symptoms?

My life time best friend has just told me she is suffering from anorexia nervosa. I am in complete shock from what she had told me ☹️ she is suffering a lot and currently has a dietician and a psychologist once a week. However, this is just not helping she is not sticking to the diet plans given and continues to eat a weetabix a day!

How do you help someone in this situation? I live around half an hour from her and not got my car to drive and see her just yet so makes it difficult. She lives on her own with a cat, she obviously sees us but then goes home and struggles it’s so sad. NHS won’t section her (UK). Doctor told her a few weeks ago she is on the brink of death if she carries on how she is and is putting so much strain on her heart.

I am now a recovered anorexic, but my whole life I have always felt awkward eating a lot in front of others/cannot eat a lot in one sitting. 

I never really thought this was a big deal, but I noticed that whenever I eat with men this seems to really bother them a lot. And not in a “concerned about you” way, in like a “off putting” and “you did something wrong/abnormal” way. I am a very short girl, and have a small mouth, so it’s not that I’m not eating, but it’s hard for me to eat fast/finish the full dish without getting really full. I don’t really see how this is a bother at all to anyone else, especially dudes who typically aren’t as food focused, but I keep getting comments like “you barely even ate anything...” “aren’t you going to eat more” “is that all you’re going to eat” with a bothered or critical tone. It feels very impolite to me because it will be food that I payed for, ate a regular amount (I’m not out here eating like 3 fries), and bring back in a doggy bag to not waste it. 

What’s funny is that then the next time I’ll eat more and they’ll be like “you ate a lot” and then ask for the rest of my food while I’m still eating LOL. Like why are you watching how much I eat and why are you offended by it? But also don’t care?

So recently, I've been beginning to notice my older sister eating less than I am. Like for example, we had made tacos earlier and I noticed that I had two and she only had one. It's made me feel absolutely awful about myself and all I want to do is relapse. (I know this sounds a bit dramatic, trust me) I've also noticed her eating less in general which is a bit unusual, and instead of me being worried, I've become increasingly agitated and triggered by it. I'm not annoyed with her as a person, but just at the fact that it seems she's eating less than me. I'm also pretty agitated with myself for feeling this way. I feel really awful about it. We are both very close, and I already know that she doesn't have an eating disorder, so it might just be some appetite issues. But still, I hate that I feel like this. I want to know how to deal with it, and to not let it get to me. But, I've always been insanely competitive and I always feel like I have to eat less than everyone around me. I really hate this about myself, and I don't want to feel that way anymore. I just want to recover in peace. Am I selfish for this? How can I deal with being so competitive?

I'm gonna spend the next 4/5 days with my family bc of a birthday and it terrifies me. 
They cook much, heavy, fatty, unhealthy, typical german food and you just know eating one meal will have more kcal than I normally allow myself. But it will not just be one, it will be three and Cake, everyday. 

Which makes me scared of gaining weight. I know much will be just bloating, water,... But that doesn't change the number on my scale. It scares me so much that it was for most of last week the only thing I could think about and only got 2 hours of sleep bc I could stop my brain

Does anyone have any tips how to deal with that fear?

On top of that did I just reach a good weight where I could be okay (even when my minds tells me otherwise)
But I will lose that and will hate myself for that.


Another thing is that I can't really eat as much anymore and then I will feel sick (like throwing up but I never do) and I hate that feeling.

1664,dr said i must be eating enough calories based on my appearance,"after years of losing my life to this shit my i am at a point where my therapist and my mom are making me see a nutritionist and are possibly going to send me to inpatient. im very lucky to have a mental health care provider and a parent who care this much, and i feel bad that i’m stressing them out to this extent, but i am very upset about all of this. my old therapist didn’t bother focusing on what i guess is now officially my ED and at that time neither did my mom. i spent over a year and a half of my childhood in a group home and the idea of going back into any type of residential treatment makes me feel like i’m going into shock.

today while at the dermatologist, my dr was asked me whether or not my diet was good. i reluctantly said no. she then with good intentions asked if i go off a typical teenage diet with a lot of “white foods” and “junk foods”. i said no, the opposite, and then once met with silence elaborated that my other health care providers don’t believe that i eat enough. she responded by saying that i “must be getting enough calories in because you look healthy.” 

she was very nice, im not mad at her. im mad at the fact that it’s not fair that my body can’t lose weight anymore but i’m not skinny and “look healthy”. i have lost out on so many experiences, friendships, relationships, just to “look healthy”. i have worked so hard and pushed myself for so long just to “look healthy”. im probably not going to be able to start college and am going to have to go back into the torture that is residential just to “look healthy”.

i suffer alone with this, never telling my friends sm them never suspecting a thing, because i “look healthy” and nobody would believe me.

1665,Dietician and therapist giving up on me,"I began seeing my therapist and dietician early this year when I was really struggling. Through the beginning of the process they were very supportive and encouraging even when I wasn’t cooperating with what they were wanting me to do. Like I felt a genuine care and compassion in our sessions if that makes sense? A few months into seeing them I was getting worse so they said I could go IP or they’d have to drop me as a client. So we looked at programs together and I applied and VERY hesitantly went. I only stayed a month because I hated it there so much. So I come back almost weight restored and very motivated to continue recovery because I didn’t want to go back IP or let them down. I stayed good for a while and over the past month I’ve been relapsing. I’m honest with them and they know what’s going on. This past week in session I was saying I never feel like I’m ever going to get better and venting about how much of a struggle this is. I was vulnerable and honestly saying I don’t want to relapse I want to recover but I’m stuck and don’t know what to do. The response I got in return was I can’t help you. She’s encouraging me to apply to IP again and I don’t want to (and won’t) go and I told her that. The rest of the session all she did was talk about how I have to go there to get better. 

Basically I’m feeling really abandoned and hopeless right now because even though they may not realize it, I use them as a major support system. I feel like that don’t want to treat me and like I get on their nerves because I feel like anytime they get the chance they just try to send me off to IP. I’m really hurt to be told that they can’t help me because I want to keep trying and I feel shut down. It’s making my urges worse because I’m feeling so anxious that they don’t like treating me??? I don’t know what to do I feel so lost.

1674,Mom cried because I am so underweight,Hello Everyone. Last night my Mom took me Fishing for a while and she took a picture of me and cried because of how I am so underweight. She also keeps telling me to take medications and to eat more but how am I supposed to eat more if I have a fear of weight gain that is like a barrier to me eating more and medications I am scared to take because of the side effects of weight gain that a lot of them have. I know side effects doesn’t mean its going to happen but I was on medication before like a year ago (Sertraline) and that put me all the way close to overweight and then I stopped taking them because my Psychiatrist was not calling me when he was supposed to and every time I call the office it goes to the voicemail so then I just stopped them and I started rapidly losing weight. I want to try to see if I can get in to see a Dietitian to see if maybe they will help me and also a therapist because of my mental health because I am also depressed and stressed due to life stuff. I just don’t know what to do anymore because she keeps telling me a million times to take medication and to eat more but she doesn’t understand about my fear of weight gain.

1678,Seeking the reassurance to go to Residential again :(,"lol I apologize I post on here a lot but nobody I know gets this. I truly feel taken over by this insidious disease and now I am scared. I just saw my former psychiatrist and he really knocked some sense into me point blank said I need to be in a res program within the next seven days or I could die any day now and he said id be lucky to see you in a year if this continues. 

Although, EVERY professional says go to treatment my brain will like go in and out of denial and acceptance. I am not dumb and manage to do very well in grad school, but my brain is like not working in any ways that matter. I have this inner demon (figuratively speaking) that is keeping me from seeing the reality/severity of how terrible and sick I look/act/etc. I still think sometimes I am “fat” and I overestimate what I eat and lie about throwing up the little amount I do eat. All I can actually eat is sugar, carbs, benzos, and nicotine. I am dating a psycho. My life is in shambles and I feel insane and I am not making any progress trying to fix this myself. I try and try but to no avail I get worse and the delusion of thinking this is normal grows. I want to finish grad school, ignore this issue, and go on with my life. However, when I am out of my states of denial the reality sets in that I just cannot live at this BMI and expect to be functional or make sound choices. I become a person whom I don’t even know. I feel like I am almost borderline with the rapid mood swings, intrusive thoughts, bad choices, impulsivity, losing friends, and I recognize it is like a slow suicide.

 I just need to commit and not leave treatment again but it fucking sucks! I tried and left because I couldn’t vape or drink caffeine constantly lol. I know it is beyond dumb. I hate residential but im 26 and I don’t want to die but can someone give any positive experiences:( 

I really need to stop prolonging this because its just a dead end and I keep going in circles and this issue hasn’t gone away because this disease is stronger than me and even though i hate the idea of gaining a singular lb I just do not want to die ugh sorry for the rant but dm me if anyone can relate",15avcxs,6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15avcxs/seeking_the_reassurance_to_go_to_residential_again/,AnorexiaNervosa

1685,DAE family not know they're anorexic?,"TW - self-harm mentioned

I feel so invalidated on this sub. I see so many of you have been hospitalized and at severe low weights and talk about how worried your families are.

I've been underweight all my teen years prior to my ED (undiagnosed), now I'm 23 having my ED for almost 3 years now and have never been hospitalized, let alone my family doesn't even know I have anorexia. I've been eating a normal amount now since I'm moved back in with my parents, and man it's tearing me apart inside. 

I can't even cut anymore either because my family doesn't know I was cutting myself when I moved out of state, my scars are mostly healed now so they haven't seen them and I just hate not being able to give myself new cuts. I just don't want them seeing them.

My BMI rn is considered ""moderately underweight"" but the lowest it's been was ""severely underweight"" but nobody really made comments about it and I guess it's because I've always already been underweight. I don't have a therapist, so the only one I talk to about my ED is with my boyfriend, aside of him nobody knows about it. I feel like I want people to know, but at the same time I feel extremely uncomfortable with the idea of my family knowing and I don't know why? It's like this digusted feeling I get imagining them knowing.

Im waiting and trying to create a life with more substance, more achievements but I only feel capable in prolonging my sickness. I can identify some strengths foreign to my eating disorder, yet it feels I am stuck and cannot employ these to get anywhere ""meaningful"" in life. I am ""good"" at creating concern, good at being fatigued, good at sticking to the diabolical routines I have confined myself to, good at understanding for a very finite length of time how to interact with the world so long as I have this anorexic ""security blanket"", I feel like I'm on the precipice of something good happening, but I can't see or feel it
 I fear this monumental change might just be a continuation of what has happened countless times: being sick and facing the consequences of it.  And yet, even identifying that really this needs to be dealt with now, I have no idea how to remin consistent, even with the idea of recovery let alone implementing it into a actionable routine. I am scared that depaite all the warning signs my body has given me, deep down, I remain unconvinced that I do need to change despite logically knowing I do.

1696,manager keeps bragging about weight loss,"so for the first half of the year, i was teetering on the edge of a relapse until i got diagnosed with celiac disease. having to check the ingredients on everything and being super cautious about what i ate just kinda pushed me over the edge into a full relapse. nobody has really noticed any of my restrictive behaviors bc i think they just assume me not eating is bc of the celiac's. it doesn't bother me at all, but as a result i think people are more comfortable talking to me about weight and food compared to whenever it was very obvious i had an ed. 

anyways, one of my managers at the store i work at has been taking wegovy for weight loss and i s2g all she ever talks about is how much weight she lost and how little she eats. she keeps mentioning the amount of weight she lost in 2 months or how she can't eat more than x calories per day without getting sick. like bringing it up unprompted several times a day.

we work in a clothing store and recently she came in on her day off to buy some things. the whole time she was there she kept talking about the amt of weight she lost and what sizes she wears now. i thought i was just being irrationally annoyed bc of how competitive this shit is, but she was literally talking about it so much that another customer noticed and made a joke abt it to us at the reg after she left.

like im happy that she's more happy or confident but holy shit now i feel like i can't eat at work (or outside of work for that matter). or that i somehow have to ""beat her"" by losing even more weight in the same time frame, which is virtually impossible. ik a lot of my work friends have noticed how much she talks abt her weight loss and are kinda annoyed, but the competition aspect of my ed is making this literal torture. ik she can't read my mind (or the room) and nobody is forcing me to do an 8 hr retail shift on an adderall and a packet of tuna. but i feel like this whole situation has made this relapse go from bad to worse bc i have a goal to work towads and an irl person to compare myself to. and to top it all off all i want is a spicy chickfila sandwich (extra pickle) from the food court and i cant have it either way, ed or no ed!! this shit sucks!!!

TLDR: manager keeps talking about wegovy weight loss and is triggering the shit out of me. and even if the issue disappeared tomorrow, i still couldn't eat what i wanted bc i got diagnosed with the lamest autoimmune disorder.

1703,Going back n forth - questioning my decision to recover daily.,"Uuughhh I just can't with this anymore. 
Two and a half months ago I checked myself into rehab for drug addiction. I was eating normal amounts of food before going there. I have never actually taken care of my eating disorder for the 7 years during which I've been living with it, just had replaced one addiction with another - anorexia with extreme substance use. After I quit using drugs, I didn't even notice how strongly the ED came back rushing into my life - into my body & mind. 
All those harmful habits n behaviours came back so fast, I felt so powerless. And thought I needed that to get through opiate withdrawal, the anxiety, the hot/cold waves, the paranoia, the psychosis I had, the shakes, etc etc. I thought to myself 'the ED isn't hurting me as much as drug addiction has' and justified it to myself and so kept doing it. Of course the weight dropped really fast and I felt euphoric as hell, well, you know how it is.
I am now out of rehab and I met someone there that I will be seeing soon (someone special one could say hah). He knows everything about my ED and other psychological issues, has been a great help to me, accepts me as I am and has been trying to help me choose recovery. And so I did - choose recovery (not for him, for ME) - or so I thought...
Now, it's, well... It's complicated. I don't know what I want anymore. I do want to get better but being a normal weight terrifies the shit out of me, mainly because the fact that I don't accept myself at a healthy BMI has made me go back to using drugs, so so many times before. Gaining the weight would be the easy part. But then, self-love, self-acceptance - that is what I need to work on and I know it.
I just know how hard the whole thing would be - recovery. And sometimes I feel like I don't have it in me to even do that. I feel like I need this disorder but also I don't want it!!!! UGH. 
I just don't know how I would live without it. How I would survive. I guess lots of you do or have felt that exact same way.
I try to challenge myself each day - but then regret doing that, feel so guilty and just go back to old patterns. I question my decision of choosing recovery each day and wonder if this is something I truly want. Because I know that I would have to give it my all and I am definitely not doing that at the moment.

Well I just kinda needed to get this out, rant about it. Though if anyone reads this and has any tips, experiences, even thoughts on the topic, feel free to share them, that would make me happy & remind me I am not alone in this world of ours.

I'm struggling with addiction, anxiety, OCD and mood disorders ontop of the eating disorder. My life has been reduced to sitting on my couch and literally doing one of these things:
-smoking (I'm not giving anyone ideas but it's a weed mix and it's terrible for you, got hooked a couple years ago and can't stop)
-playing dreamlight valley 
-watching modern family, new girl, Brooklyn 9-9, schitts creek and suite life on deck
-doom scrolling 
-planning for a better life I don't think I'll ever get. 
-and can't forget the back and foot rubs from my not-brother-brother haha 

When I'm at home I'm wishing Id be out with friends, and when I'm with friends all I wish is to be home. I don't look deathly ill from the outside yet, but you can tell. And I have all the health symptoms you'd expect, I'm having issues with my kidneys so I need to pee all the time, I abuse laxatives so somedays I can't leave my house, I'm tired all the time, my brain function is obviously affected because I'm slow, 90% of what's said in a conversation goes over my head because I'm too spacy to understand what they're saying, some days its like they're speaking another language that I've learned a few sentences of, I can pick up some words but they're speaking too fast so it's hopeless to try keep up. Not to mention my brain is just full of myself all. The. Time. And I hate it, I feel so self-absorbed and selfish. I can't handle a conversation with someone much less keep up meaningful relationships. And the very few people who have pushed hard to be in my life I eventually avoid so much they leave. Which I hate! But I always say I'm going to hang out, make plans, time comes around and I bail because I'm not feeling good or I'm anxious or I just want to sit, smoke and be lazy. 
I can't keep up relationships, much less a job or an education. I'm just sitting in my crappy, small, bird infested apartment, living off my parents, waiting for something to happen. 
I'm not sure how much more I can take of this, and I'm trying to turn it around, but it's taking time and it's hard. 
One day though.

Imagine gaining twice the weight you got down to, I hate it. So sometimes since I've relapsed I don't eat meals, then if I do have something I feel like I'm not anorexic because I stopped starving myself for that snack oe meal. I have the books I need I just don't read them. I have no desire to read them even though they have the info I need. I know what a full meal is supposed to look like. 
A few days ago I went out with my husband to celebrate our 10th anniversary, before that a bunch of teens came into a shop and acted like i wasn't worthy to go literally where I was turning to look at some things. I thought how i used to be them just 1 year ago, how i was thinner last year. That stayed with me, went to the restaurant, got a salad but even then thought doesn't this make sense people think I'm doing the right thing being in a larger body ordering a salad. I couldn't even eat half of it. My husband encouraged me and I got just 1 more bite in. (His help and care was huge  in that moment) I was going to finish the rest the car but it just didn't happen. I hope I didn't bore anyone with all this. Recovery is hard, relapse sucks, no Ed sucks.",158vlpu,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/158vlpu/thoughts/,AnorexiaNervosa

1711,Amenorrhea and pregnancy scares,"I'm in a very tough situation. I am not yet an adult but am legally allowed to consent to sex in my state. I also have a mom diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder who, very frankly, doesn't actually care about me. I really really wanted to go on birth control, but that didn't really get anywhere when I asked my mom. I also have a boyfriend of almost one year, and we have a very good sex life, but I always remember to use the pull out method around my ovulating window. Obviously, though, you can never be safe from pregnancy when a man is ejaculating inside of you.

I also have anorexia and bulimia which is widely known to cause amenorrhea, especially at the rate that I've been doing things recently. Although I am a very anxious person and I always worry that my latest binge was enough for ovulation to occur at some random time that I wasn't expecting, and I ended up getting pregnant. Right now, I have gone a couple of days of a missed period, and I am freaking out that I may be pregnant.

I am deathly afraid of the outcome with my mom if I end up getting pregnant. She is ruthless and will take any measure to make me feel terrible about myself and make me suffer. Does anyone have advice? Can anyone else relate to pregnancy scares vs. amenorrhea?

1714,had a huge raging/sobbing breakdown today because of my psychiatrist,"i (15f) have suffered from anorexia since i was 12. it’s been a long, grueling battle and i was in recovery for a while, but i relapsed this year and was hospitalized again. anyway, i’ve been home for almost three months now, but i’m still really struggling. today, i had a meeting with my medication prescriber. she’s a nurse practitioner with no background in eating disorders, and clearly no understanding because she sent me spiraling. she asked me how i feel about my body, and i told her i hate it and feel fat. she asked for my height and weight, and so i told her. she then said “that’s great, that’s perfect!” i immediately turned away and started SOBBING because i’ve been told for months that i am underweight and need to gain. my mom said “um no, she’s underweight” and the NP’s response was “i guess she could maybe put on a couple of pounds, but i think that X is good.” FYI, my doctor is even still threatening to put me in IP because i won’t gain. it was so horrifying and invalidating and awful to hear. i already don’t believe to gain weight, but wow, hearing a professional say that broke me. she also suggested my i should treat my liver problem (which, mind her, was CAUSED BY MALNUTRITION) by cutting down on fat, sugar, and carbs. i had an emergency meeting with my therapist because i was screaming and crying and my mom started crying too because i was so upset. i’m so hurt and fucking angry. i’ve calmed down a bit but i know i’m just gonna cry more later.",158pwg8,13,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/158pwg8/had_a_huge_ragingsobbing_breakdown_today_because/,AnorexiaNervosa

1716,another family vacation ruined,"i am from colorado and my family and i are in florida for vacation. they’ve rented this big air bnb and we go out to eat every day for at least two meals. they’ve been on my ass at home for not eating enough so i decided to eat all meals and snacks on vacation so they’d think i’m okay. i didn’t realize how miserable this would make me though. 

since the house we’ve been staying in is absolutely huge i have my own room. now i know i can workout at night when everyone’s asleep and it’s not that i’m lazy (or maybe it is) but it’s that i’ve been fainting a lot recently and i don’t want to risk hitting my head on the ground without anyone knowing. 

i have been isolating and avoiding my family on this vacation because i’m too busy thinking about food. i am also a recovering addict and the drugs i was doing are known for making people drop weight fast, so using has been heavy on my mind also. (PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT CONSIDER USING DRUGS FOR WEIGHT LOSS, THEY WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE.)

my parents have been yelling at me about being distant and how i’m “ungrateful” for this trip. trust me i’m trying very hard to enjoy it and i am ever so grateful, but food is poisoning my mind and i can’t seem to get out.

1721,Trans anorexic,"TL;DR at bottom, kinda of a long vent

I can’t gain weight , and I just want to be at my old weight :(

Hi y’all, I’m trans MTF, and I feel as though me and my trans friends have dealtt with some form of Ana or ED. I feel as though a lot of the trans community regularly deal with EDs (and self harm) but I wish this correlation was talked about more, it’s so common! It’s common for mtf and ftm folk, androgyny, femininity, and masculinity value thinness, value a sharp jaw, prominent collar bones etc. What I’ve noticed though is that my ANA had gotten horrible, I was at my lowest weight most disordered etc. But as I got on hormones and started noticing changes in fat distribution and breast’s growing etc. I became so much more comfortable that slowly I started eating more and more. (I also started self harming less, coincidence? Lol I think not)

I wish trans folk could just get the gender affirming hormones, surgery’s, etc. I feel like I went to my lowest weight just so that when I gained weight it would be “feminine” and eventually I’d be thin enough to pass as a girl. What I’ve found though is that the more weight I gain (starting at my low weight) I just get more and more changes, the hormones work better , etc. I really wish I could have just started the process earlier, My ED had developed before starting hormones and I didn’t realize how much it was effecting the changes, slowing them down. 

If I had been able to start hormones earlier I maybe would have avoided this further development of my ED. 

My eating has gotten a bit better since starting hormones, but now I’m stuck in the ED mindset. My ED is loud as ever and I’m still stuck with these disordered thoughts and behaviors. It’s really a struggle to finally want to gain weight and “recover”but I feel stuck in this fucking anorexic night mare. Anyways thanks for reading. I’m don’t being mad about the lack of trans affirming medical care; I’m just so fed up ! I’m wondering if anyone can relate. Let me know if you’ve also noticed this I feel alone  

TL;DR: Anorexia developed because gender dysphoria, ANA took me to my lowest weight, finally got to start hormones, I want to gain weight to look more “feminine” (in my eyes) but I’m stuck in the ANA cycle. Maybe if I got the care I needed the ANA wouldn’t have developed or I wouldn’t have gotten so sick.

1722,Stress not-eating,"For the past year or so, and off and on before then, unless I’m in a really good mood or the food is out of this world, I’ve hated eating. I hate the taste in my mouth. I have to push food to the side to chew so I don’t taste it. 
I often can’t tell the difference between feeling hungry and wanting to puke, so I wait until I have to eat in order to concentrate.

It’s much worse when I’m stressed, which is all the time because I have poor emotional regulation and dislike my career path.

I don’t have an unhealthy body image in the sense that I’m not doing this to be thin. I can recognize that I am unhealthy, and I am too thin. When friends see me nowadays they comment on it without fail. I used to think maybe it was because I used to wear my husband’s baggy clothes most days and recently I’ve been wearing my own clothing again, but that wouldn’t explain why even my family tells me I’m looking thin. Technically I’ve only lost a few pounds, but I didn’t have much to lose in the first place. 

The in-laws are in town for this month which is great because I adore them and they’ve taken a big load off my shoulders by cooking a lot, but it also means my gig of pretending everything’s fine is up. In-laws want to know, ‘why isn’t she eating? Does it taste bad? Is something wrong?’ When it was just my husband I was able to explain it away better, but I can’t with three sets of eyes on me.

I don’t know how to explain it. It’s not that I don’t want to get better, but I’m dreading having to eat when I don’t want to. 

Hubby is taking me to urgent care tomorrow to get checked out, and probably get a diagnosis I guess. Wish me luck.",158es8j,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/158es8j/stress_noteating/,AnorexiaNervosa
1723,"My friend suffers from anorexia, and she triggers me","I don't really know what to do. My friend suffers from anorexia nervosa. We're at very different stages. She's still deep into it, while I'm trying to recover.

This friend and I often talk about our issues. She's 20yr and goes through similar hardships that I went through myself and I like giving her advices on things, encouraging her etc, despite my own mental health problems. And I do so too, less frequently, but giving her advices helps me to have more retrospect on my own situations. It's a win win situation for both of us.


So often, she also vents to me about how she doesn't like her body, her weight goals, how she doesn't eat and how much weight she loses because of it. And as much as I appreciate that she feels comfortable enough to talk to me about it, I'm trying to recover from my own eating disorders, and listening to her talk about this triggers me a lot. It's been less than a year since I'm trying to recover so I'm still very sensitive to this type of discussion. I've recently relapsed into anorexia because of a discussion we had a month or two ago. I'm 18yr who lives alone without any support system, so it's complicated to snap out of this mental state by myself. 


I don't know how to deal with it. I know she isn't doing this on purpose, and I want to support her as much as I can. But she isn't ready to recover yet, which I understand because it's very hard, I've been there after all. But I also care about my own mental health and sometimes it's just mentally draining to hear her talk about how much weight she lost, watching the body checking videos, her saying how disgusted she is by food etc.

I have suffered from Anorexia-BP for 5 years and I recovered all by myself because they take way too damn long to offer any help, I was severely underweight and never got a proper diagnosis because I was never professionally assessed when I was underweight and I think most of you can relate that having one is a nice validating feeling.

They diagnosed me with ADHD and are now giving me therapy for emotion regulation and learning how to identify them. They wrote a report about me and they dare saying that 'in the past my symptoms would have been enough to diagnose me with Anorexia Nervosa, at this moment there is no question of an eating disorder.'

Reading this triggered my so bad and I just wanted to burst out crying in front of my therapist at how invalidated it made me feel and even though I'm at a healthy weight now that doesn't mean I'm still struggling and have relapse thoughts.

1734,I don't think I'll ever be able to recover...,"I'm not shit-talking recover, not at all, I just... I need to get this off my chest. 

I'm, well, I'm overweight, I used to be obese, diagnosed with atypical anorexia.

And I won't lie, I often feel like I'll never be able to truly recover until I at least know how it's like to be thin, I have been overweight practically my whole life.

I also recently lost the only thing that could be some sort of motivation to recover; I was, well, still am, desperate for adhd meds, I was lying to my doctors for over half a year saying I'm in recovery. It got me nowhere, I'm afraid with ""F50.1"" in my papers it's truly a lost cause.

And so.... I gave up, lost my only drive in life, without meds I can never hope to fulfill my only dream in life 

I came clean to my doctors, they're genuinely horrified and kinda losing their minds trying to figure out what to do with me, one is threatening to section me, the other is telling me I'm going to die

Eh... idk man I honestly just don't have any reason to even try anymore, what's the point?

I'm a disabled loser, I live in the middle of nowhere, I Will never be able to fulfill my dream, I don't even have any friends here 

In my hollow and empty life, anorexia gives me a reason to live and keep going, because maybe things will get better when I'm thinner, maybe, they have to...

It's a coping mechanism... One I can't get rid of, for as long as my life is hollow and meaningless 

And the way things are now, it's unlikely my life will gain any meaning anytime soon.

1737,i just don’t know what to do anymore…,"okay i’ve got so much running through my head and i just need to dump it somewhere and hopefully maybe get some advice??

so i’ve had AN for around 5 years now and in that time had many admissions to both public and private hospitals, as well as fluctuated in weight, had short periods of semi-recovery and had relapses.

at the moment though i just feel so f****ng lost.
i am currently in a public hospital and am on a meal plan and on 24hr bed rest. i haven’t been complying with the meal plan because 1. it’s far too much for me to eat it all and 2. im meant to be supervised while i eat but not every nurse is very vigilant so depending on how much they are or aren’t i will hide more/less food. but for the most part they’ve been pretty not alert so i’ve been hiding majority of the food. i try and eat at least enough though to stay stable.

 i find it so so impossible to find reasons to eat. i rarely feel hungry except for in the mornings and im only eating a bit at the moment here because i ‘have’ to. because if i don’t i’ll get tubed etc. 
ultimately i want to go home, but i know if my anxiety gets in the way i won’t be able to sustain things. i’ve told my mum i want to try and just stabilise, maintain my weight, but the thing is that is going to still require me to eat. sometimes i feel like i might be able to cope with eating something manageable but enough at home and other times i feel like the anxiety just takes over and does not want me to eat at all.

i’ve been to a private clinic before but the program is a voluntary one and also there’s not much room for preference in terms of management. i personally don’t feel with where i’m at at the moment that they can cater for me especially if i can hardly get through my meals. there’s also the fact that it’s not enforced on me and so i know my ed will use that to its advantage and i may end up just rejecting food there too.

im still currently sectioned so technically stuck in this hospital as i have been for two weeks, but it’s just getting to the point where i can see im not getting anything out of being here… but i don’t know where to go from here.

i want to live a life and do things. but i am also scared. i can’t bring myself to eat when that voice takes over, it makes me so anxious i either freeze up or curl in a ball and howl for hours or want to bash my head on the wall or claw at my skin because i am so uncomfortable in my body. or sometimes it’ll make me pace around (which i can’t here obviously cause im stuck to a bed) for ages and ages.

i just don’t have any incentive or want to eat. i want to live but i don’t. i want to move on with my life but i can’t. i just don’t feel capable of any changes yet i fucking hate how things are. i don’t want to gain weight even though everyone wants me to. im just so lost. where do i go from here. if i go home and can’t cope it means more fights and more admissions and if i stay here im obviously doing shit cause im just hiding all the food and it’s just a general hospital so no one is educated in eating disorders. if i go home and tryyyy my best to eat it might keep me out but then there’s the fear that it won’t and i’ll be eating and will still have to go back to hospital or a clinic. 
i don’t want to fight with people i just want to be alone but i also know if i was alone i just wouldn’t eat, or at least not much or enough anyway. but eating more makes me so incredibly anxious i spiral. 

what is my life im just so fucking lost i’m sorry i don’t know what i’m really saying anymore other than i just don’t know what the answer is it seems like there is truly no way out, no answer… 😣😞",15771t4,8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/15771t4/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,AnorexiaNervosa

I am really curious about how those with severe restrictive eating see themselves. Anorexia is characterized by an extreme preoccupation with weight and body image.

Or are there different thoughts that maintain the eating disorder? This question is asked with absolutely no judgement, ED’s are horrible and terrifying and absolutely all-consuming. They are so difficult to treat and to those of you who are dealing with this, I know you are quite literally fighting for your lives. I’m just trying to better understand what keeps maintaining the disorder even when you are at the point where you know, objectively, that you are much thinner than most other people.

1750,"Trying to ""recover""","Spoiler: my story is completely bizarre and stupid. 

Im gonna sound really weird but Ive had anorexia for a week now. I know. Stupid. But what happened was I got really frustrated with my belly fat and no amount of exercise worked so I started a no sugar diet which has been confirmed that it works for belly fat. But then I search up thinspo on tumblr and things went downhill from there. Slowly I started following all the anorexia tags and I became addicted. I have a personality prone to addictions and its really easy for me to get completely absorped in something. My whole mindset changed within days. I never counted calories and I actually was insecure of my skinny body and now I dont think Im skinny *enough*. Its crazy. It got to a point where Im scared to eat a peach or a yoghurt because of calories. I realized that if I dont stop, Im gonna be in a lot of trouble. 

So what I did was I deleted tumblr and pinterest. I decided Im gonna just do my no sugar diet (i did it last year as well for health reasons)and that Im gonna eat 3 times a day like a normal person. Well, its easier said than done. The obsessive thoughts just wont stop. I keep seeing calories instead of nutrients. I keep thinking im gonna get fat if I eat a banana or one cookie. Im really worried for myself and i know I should do something with it but its only been a week.

1755,"It's a disorganized mess, but I needed to vent...","I'm trying to recover from my anorexia relapse on my own since I don't have and can't afford any medical help (my job doesn't offer insurance cuz I work only 30 hours/week). I have a pretty decent support system with my boyfriend and his family. I'm very honest about my behaviors when it comes to food, and everyone looks out for warning signs then distracts me. I just struggle to eat breakfast and lunch, because I live alone (this is important to note because I've noticed I need verbal reminders to eat, not just alarms) and I need to work through the times I would normally eat lunch. At dinner, it really depends whether I eat or not. A lot of the times, I can't afford groceries and food banks I can go to are only open while I'm at work. I'm always allowed at my boyfriend's house for food, but I feel guilty because they're also financially struggling. BF also orders me food from Doordash when he can afford it, which makes me feel worse because I'm never able to finish a meal, and he spent extra money on the food to get it delivered (plus all the extra fees). 

I've told my boyfriend and his mom what I learned about eating disorders when I was in residential 6 years ago (I was 14, 20 now). They know my triggers, and for the most part how to support me. BF has even been doing his best to be careful with the words he uses to explain things or talk. 

I'm starting to feel like a burden to them. They do so much to help me, but I can't do anything to help them. Even if his mom catches me helping with the chores, she'll tell me ""stop. you know you don't need to do that. I'll do it later."" She's asked my bf to do some chores while I was there one day. I decided to do them instead, and she told me to let my bf do it. It just feels like I NEED to do something to repay them, because they've already helped a lot in my recovery process, despite it not being 100% yet. I'm positive they're the reason I'm feeling more energized. Without that family, I most likely would not have continued to eat after moving away from my own family. I didn't notice my eating habits after moving out until my jeans didn't fit me. Looking back, I only ate while I was with my friends or boyfriend - which was not very often due to work.

Writing this I'm thinking that maybe I shouldn't be living alone. I think I might need residential again, but because of money that's out of the question. BF and I are talking about moving in together soon, but that would mean he would be with me every single day, and have me eat every single day. Not only does that thought give me anxiety, but I feel guilty for it because I know how frustrating and difficult it can be to help an anorexic. It's a lot for my bf mostly because he's the one dealing with my outbursts. I get so frustrated when I need to eat more than I'm used to, and the frustration quickly turns to anger. I feel awful about my behaviors after the fact, and I've actively been trying to work on them, but sometimes I can't let go of those feelings. But if we move in together, he might have to put up with more behaviors and I'm terrified of that. I don't want to be a burden to him, but it feels like that's what I am. Not being able to repay anyone just makes me feel the need to vent.

Btw, we've been dating almost 18 months. I'm originally from the SF Bay Area, moved to the Chicago area just over a year ago to be closer to him. I was planning on moving to IL anyways, I visited Chicago in January 2022 (over my birthday) to experience the winter weather before moving to the state. I kinda regret leaving California for Illinois, but I don't at the same time because of my new family here.

1766,"this week i havent really experienced alot of guilt from eating, BUT","It feels like anything that isnt my comfy restrictive meal makes my stomach feel so AAAAAA, like it feels like i have a fucking dumbell in me and my body genuinely needs days to digest a meal that isnt my plain simple clean meal, carbs especially (always had this issue but after restrictive eating it got worse) i am not even like underweight yet but it just feels so...my stomach is like... i hope this dosent break the numbers rule but after eating more carbs i have for a few days one extra unit and it feels uncomfortable


Like it also kinda hurts and my heart accelerates, and PS, i do NOT, binge, unless you count eating like an average person to be a binge which i gues for me it kinda is? I dont feel guilt necessarily tho that might be because i reaaaaaaallly avoid the scale for a few days after something like this happens, only to then return to my diet that is easier for my stomach to handle


One of my biggest fears is having complications with my insides and just dying, like genuinely its scary, and then i look at the LITERALLY safe foods and i go like ""mmmmm yes this will be easier on my stomach, plus it tastes familiar and comfortable""",154qpjn,19,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/154qpjn/this_week_i_havent_really_experienced_alot_of/,AnorexiaNervosa

Literally every fucking thing and I think my ED is probably just the tip of the ice-berg that people can see but i believe it is all attributed to the other mental issues/addictions I have had in the past. 

I really lack insight into how I look and everyone in my family tries to explain how terrible it is to see but I genuinely still think I am fat even at an absurdly low weight. I have moments where I realize I am sick looking but go in and out of acceptance and denial as I am sure many people have too. If I am honest I just want to be x weight with no mental issues or medical problems. However, this isn’t possible. I am 26 and feel like a 14 year old mentally. 

All of my mental issues are exaggerated by this disease that I honestly don’t even remember purposely choosing as the general population seems to think anorexia is a choice. I never said I am “trying to starve” it just sort of happened in my sobriety and here I am today feeling more mental than ever. 

Anyway… does anyone have any experience with zyprexa or other med recs. I obviously am scared to take certain medications because of the weight gain side affect but also feel so mental I can’t deal with it anymore.

I hate being here but I think I hate home more and that feels rotten.

They'll see how slow I eat, all my weird food rituals, or u know see me outright not finish a plate, and I can guarantee they'll yell at me and get pissed, probably accuse me of ""ruining the trip""

Since then I’ve been letting myself eat every day (sometimes multiple times a day) and then purging it all - most of the time not even tracking. I have zero self control and keep craving food. I feel disgusting and ashamed and I’ve gained weight. It feels like I’m beyond out of control and I’m losing my mind. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

I’m convinced that I don’t have an eating disorder, much less AN, and I’m just disgusting and made everything up. Just a week ago I was crying over my therapist trying to make me eat a cracker in session.  

Has anyone else experienced this? I don’t know what to do or what’s wrong with me.

1821,Binge dissociated?,"So i restrict heavy and it becomes a thin line between constantly fasting. When i break fasts it’s for the bare minimum of fiber or protein. I’ve been pretty tired and crash during workouts past few days. Something came over me and I wanted to eat my protein bar I saved with some fruit. That’s like THE big meal for me. But then a couple bites in.. my mind actually stopped. I don’t have any thoughts and I become animalistic. This has happened couple other times in the past. I believe it’s a form of dissociation at this point. I start watching myself eat more from my kitchen and I’m mentally screaming to stop but the physical brain in my body is telling me to try and taste anything I want in the kitchen to find a satisfaction that won’t be met. Disappointed I mindlessly move to something else. I wish I could say I lack control in these moments but I’m not there mentally. There is no connection between my mind and body. It is really scary being ravenous . The Anorexia mind will preach self control but I become a mammal in these moments that control doesn’t matter. Nothing matters !!my body is just trying to get satisfied. If you watch nature documentaries like me , you may know what I’m getting at. I just feel like a mf lion watching prey. I sit hungry and tired at a distance. Eventually it is either to die in the wild or the instincts to use my teeth and hunt what is ever in front of me. This is why i restrict so hard. This is my biggest fear that if i just have portioned sizes ,the animal inside take over. It’s silly as it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy lol. I’ve been having nightmares lately too ed unrelated. Genuinely food is a waking nightmare for me. But yes like i said , it’s like a dissociation feeling because in those moments life is a dreamstate and I’m observing an action i don’t want to be doing .",14zy91s,7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14zy91s/binge_dissociated/,AnorexiaNervosa

I do have a therapist and a nutritionist I'm meeting with on a weekly basis. My therapist I've been seeing for almost two years, my nutritionist has only been for about two months.

My mom brought home applesauce and got mad at me for not eating it, or how I stopped drinking milk and eating peanut butter.

Been working on my diet a bit recently, including more fibre and eating more nutrient dense foods (failing miserably) and horribly constipated again a week later. Took recommended dose of laxatives and hoping for the best.

1827,Heart problems when not underweight?,"vent/question: i dont really have anyone to talk to about these things sorry if its all over the place. 

Is it possible to experience heart problems from restricting if you aren't already underweight. I don't actually know my weight because i dont have a scale/choose not to know to avoid triggering myself. I think ive lost a significant amount of weight in the past 2-3 months? people have noticed the weight loss but i don't think im underweight. I have started experiencing heart palpitations/skipping a beat and it scares me a lot. Ive seen my doctor about it and they said its probably psychosomatic, because my heart rate and blood pressure are fine (although my blood pressure is very close to being too low), but im still scared about it, especially because ive been told other serious problems were psychosomatic in the past until further down the line when they got worse. I've suffered from disordered eating and reactive eating for as long as i can remember, but this problem started after a long period of restriction. Sometimes the short heart palpitations are accompanied by chest pains!! Ive tried to increase my electrolytes too, and it seems to help but doesn't stop the problem. They usually happen randomly 2-5 times a day. This isn't the only health problem ive been noticing but its the one that scares me the most. I've been trying to move towards recovery/maintaining and to have a healthier relationship with food because of how much this has been worrying me, but I feel out of control now and every attempt to be healthier makes me feel so much worse about myself and i start restricting and over exercising. Not really sure what to do, i've tried finding a therapist to help with this too but the wait times are at least 3 months and the last therapist i opened up to about ed stuff ghosted me, so im weary of a new one.",14zsfg9,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14zsfg9/heart_problems_when_not_underweight/,AnorexiaNervosa

I'm totally fixated on it currently and this is my messy meal tracker page (hid anything that could be triggering).   
While I'm nowhere near ready to recover yet, I try to combine my need for control with mindfulness and creative outlet and make something somewhat positive out of it, also added coping mechanisms and self care stuff to the bottom of the pages.  


I'm a sucker for obnoxious word plays and was super proud to come up with the super discrete RnB (ya know, like that vicious binge and restrict cycle, but the other way round) Manager headline :D  
Almost finished, I slipped and put a huge line across the left page and almost flipped the table.   
Wondering what to do with it, I remembered I had a measure band washi tape I thought I wouldn't use because it's only triggering. So I put them on both sides of the page and doodled stuff over it to make a point of  rendering the numbers invisible :)  

Rant over, thought I'd share and maybe someone would like it lol

1834,I told my boyfriend I hate lunch time and now he's always inviting me to have lunch with him,"My boyfriend (23) knows I (22) have anorexia since the beginning of our relationship. In fact, he was the first one to even notice my behavior as an eating disorder and even asked me, without forcing it, if I struggle with that, when we were just friends. He's so attentive and caring.

I engaged in an awful semi recovery, but relapsed some months ago and even though I am really not that bad, it's... Getting worse. He knows it and it hurts him. 

Some days ago we're talking and we hit the topic ""anorexia"" and for some reason I started detailing everything I did in my worst phase, which he listened carefully till I end. At some point I said that I hate lunch time and I hate having lunch 'cause it's always the worst meal time for me. I remember saying it ""still is"" and it makes me anxious all the time. He said nothing, I kept going. 

Next day, he asked me if I could have lunch with him. Invited me to his home and I went, because I didn't really wanna eat, but I really wanted to see him. Anyway, he didn't push me to anything nor made any comment (about plate size/portion, weight, etc) and we ate together. After that, he started talking, making plans, asking me different things like: ""What'll you do today? How's your cats? When is that recital thing you told me you'll play? When will we watch Barbie?"", the most random topics... Which now I see is to distract me of guilty and anxious thoughts. Well, I might add it worked. Easily and painlessly, worked. Not for the full day, but most of it.

Next day, same thing. He did it for a whole week now, always asking if ""can we have a better dinner today?"", which I know he means ""bigger"" dinner, or asking me what I want for dinner and doing it without any other questions. He also asked me if the next day we could go out to eat (I understood it as him trying to make me prepare myself mentally) and we wouldn't go if I said no... I agreed, but didn't agreed for dessert. 

Honestly, it was a good week. He didn't force me nor push me nor even talked about ""anorexia stuff"", he just invited me to eat with him and even if I'd put too little on my plate, he'd not comment on it. I also noticed it became easier to eat whatever I wanted, even though I was portion-controlling. Indeed, I think I ate more than my ""normal"" this week, but I don't really feel guilty for that.

It's so sweety though. He's being attentive enough and taking care of me without saying a word, making comfy and helping so much, I hope he knows that. It's a cute way to help me and it's making me consider recoverying more than anything ever did. Surely I won't recover only because of him, but I know it'll be a lot easier with someone I love this much (and loves me back) rooting and helping me.

1847,No longer want to recover/have kids?,"
I am in my mid 20's and have been dealing with anorexia and overexercising since I was a teenager. In and out of treatment but haven't been weight restored in over a decade. No period in that time. I have been just barely hanging on in terms of weight and physical health, and I know (and boy do my doctors tell me) that it isn't a safe place to be. 

I used to want to recover. I dreamed of having my own children and a flourishing career. My husband was the one who motivated me most because I dreamt of us building a beautiful life together.

I am married. I own a home. I work my dream job. But I no longer want to recover. 

I gave up on the idea of having my own kids; I'm too scared anyway. I don't want to weight restore. I told my husband that the other night and it absolutely crushed him. I feel so selfish, but it is so hard to want to change when I am functioning and living (or at least, living to my fullest capacity with the ed). 

I don't know what to do or what I am asking for, I guess just looking for some support. Thanks y'all.",14y7r34,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14y7r34/no_longer_want_to_recoverhave_kids/,AnorexiaNervosa
1848,Is restrictive eating still problematic if you're not underweight?,"Since early June, I've been restricting my calorie intake to a very low range per day. I feel better the lower number is, and I've had a few days in this span of time where I'll fast for a day. I'm only able to eat two foods without worrying about weight gain, anything else makes me nervous.

At this point, eating too much will make my stomach cramp up so bad that it can almost drive me to tears. I have a pretty high pain tolerance but the pain is insane. I guess my body has adapted to eating only these two specific foods and anything that breaks the pattern freaks out my stomach.

If I was underweight I would take this more seriously, but I'm not. I'm in the average BMI range. Actually, before June, I was overweight. I've lost a ton of weight since then. People are congratulating me for getting healthy and treating it like a victory that I've lost all the weight, and I feel conflicted about it.

Is it only a problem if people restrict like this when they're underweight? Is it normal that I want to continue restricting to this degree and see how much more weight I can lose? Or is this disordered thinking? As someone on the autistic spectrum, I have worries that this is just healthy behavior that I'm overthinking.",14y4xf9,49,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14y4xf9/is_restrictive_eating_still_problematic_if_youre/,AnorexiaNervosa

1857,TW!! Asking for advice: it used to just be counting calories and now it's completely taken over my life.,"I'm not new to this diagnosis unfortunately, but I am finally ready to admit to myself that I have it. Unfortunately, since I've come to terms with this fact I've developed a couple new habits, other than just severe calorie restriction.

I have been struggling with my calorie intake since I was 12. Before that, I was a competitive dancer and didn't need to try, I moved so much I was always in a deficit. Well, I quit dancing due to financial issues, and I lost my muscle tone, and gained a lot of weight. Unfortunately this happened right as I was going through puberty. My body was used to me burning a set amount of calories, and adjusted accordingly as I went through puberty. I gained about a third of my body weight as I started high school. Horrible experience, but I never actually admitted to having the disease. Then covid happened, and I got better, temporarily. Flash forward, I'm 18, I refuse to eat more calories than I actively burn, add my base deficit on top of that and I lose about a half pound a day. I'm addicted to my fitbit, I refuse to take it off even in the shower, unless I'm charging it, in which case I sit on the floor next to it unmoving because I will not do anything without it on my wrist to tell me how much I've burned. I weigh myself about 6 times a day - after I drink water, after I eat, after I use the washroom, and log it all obsessively. I went completely vegan, in an attempt to stay away from meat, bread and cheese, without letting my mom know what's going on, I spent over 800$ (I hope this use of number is okay?) on something called ""body contouring"" which actually did work, but I stopped going when I realized that it worked because part of me felt tempted to eat more since I didn't have to work so hard. I wake up at 5:00am every day to go on an hour long jog, I'm at the gym for three hours every night after work - which I get off of at midnight. I only buy clothes that are sizes too small for me, telling myself I'll force them to fit me, rip the tags off right away so I can't bring them back, stare at them every time I get hungry, I've started to fit them now and it's just made it worse, I've gone from a few sizes down, to enough that the sales people ask if they're gifts. I've been diagnosed with anemia because all I eat are vegetables. I buy any and every cream or lotion that says it's good for skin tightening, trying to delude myself into thinking that it's just loose skin. I'm not ready to ask for help, but I never had these habits before I relapsed, and I'm not sure what to do. I can't keep living like this.

1859,Recovery and relapse,"37f. Anyone recovering sometimes feel like your failing at recovery and at being anorexic?
I feel like I'm going no where with my recovery,  that I'm relapsing. And when I do eat the way I was taught to, I feel like I can't claim that I'm anorexic. But then I barely eat. And then I feel like I'm really wanting to eat and fighting with myself whether to eat. I've heard of people talking about safe foods. When I was at the eating disorder unit, they gave me things I wouldn't have usually, so being home I have pretty much what I feel like nothing new. Then I'm overthinking the cholesterol of things because of what I saw in April. My doctor told me it would take decades to get to a very bad place. Maybe I'm overthinking that because of the numbers from last year at the hospital when they told me on discharge that my numbers were ""exquisite"". I was also tiny. Now that I really overshoot my original weight I'm struggling alot. I see my doctor in 6 days. No psych., no good therapist, and no dietitian at the moment. Need support. Need advice.

1862,Looking back at early signs,"Ps tbh i was hesitant to rwite this since i am basically letting myself vulnerable to 1000s of ppl which i didnt rly wanna do but here we go

I remember years ago when i used to avoid eating or drinking anything before going to a meetup be it with a friend or whatever because i was scared i will somehow friggin piss or shit myself (this NEVER happend) but i always had this fear in my mind at the back of my brain, i still have this fear tbh

I was disgusted by my body, and tbh to some extent i still am, I went from obese to lean in the span of less than a year basically.

I remember one thing i used to do was force myself to trow up randomly after a meal, or not eat for a whole day, and back then i was like ""i am just dieting"" but i look at it now and its like... oh. my. god.

Right now i am scared of most foods and whenever i eat its not even to follow cravings its just that i dont wanna die, i end up eating really low and once in a few days actually fill my BMR to keep me going.

Also one thing i noticed is that now sitting down can be painful if its not a soft area, or even touching my knees qhen i lay on bed, and i am not even underweight, just skinny.

Right now this tbh isnt really about being skinny, its about routine and control over my body, i feel very like... pure?

Friends keep saying I'm wasting away etc. I've never been diagnosed with anything other than BPD, anxiety and depression. In high school I had severely restricted calories and went underweight. Eventually I gained weight and have been fairly healthy looking. I've never been overweight. Now I'm in my early 30s and I don't know what's happened but it's all come back. I am OBSESSED with weight, like my mood hinges on what the scales say. I have to get a minimum of x amount of steps in and I'm jogging loads. I feel like it is taking over my life but at the same time it brings me so much comfort. If I have paranoid or sad thoughts I just think about weight goals and food plan etc and I feel like everything will be okay. I'm still a healthy BMI etc so I feel like I don't have a right to question what's happening. I feel like frenemies with my own body. My friends are concerned and I'm terrified of gaining weight. 
Is this an eating disorder? My friends are saying they think I have one. I want to understand but I don't want to lose control of my food and body.

All my symptoms are back and worse then ever. I’m just scared of going back inpatient. I can’t do that again even though I know it might be good for me. I just feel like if I go back, I’m admitting defeat. I just can’t afford/let myself take time for myself. It doesn’t feel like I deserve it when I know I could be doing more. Ana is crushing me every day and I just want her to go THE FUCK AWAY😡😡. Even for just one day would be a relief. It’s so difficult when the fight is almost entirely mental. I can’t take medication to help me like other mental health disorders. I’m just tired of every day seeming harder than the last. I just want it to stop sometimes. The relief would be amazing. As much as I want it, I know I have to keep fighting. I understand that this will get better, but it can just feel so far away sometimes. Anyway….. just wanted to vent some…

1874,Feels like the “harm reduction” approach is FAR more realistic than actual full Recovery…,"Since I was 10 my ED has shifted between restricting, restrict/binge/purge, and extreme Binge/purge. During the binge/purge time where I wasn’t fasting intermittently, I gained a significant amount of weight. Since 2019 I’ve been pretty consistent with mostly restricting, and lost A LOT (family says “too much”) in the process. It had been a VERY long time since I’ve eaten the “recommended amount” for the day, but yesterday I was home alone and I just…kept eating. Like every couple hours I had a snack. I felt so guilty so much shame to the point where I felt like I was out of control and ended up purging a couple times. I haven’t purged in 6 months, ever since I saw the dentist and had to take out a friggin loan to cover all the work that needed to be done to fix my dental damage. Anyway, today I’ve been so scared to even START eating, cuz I feel like if I have some food I won’t be able to stop, and I’d rather be hungry then feel full and purge.

I want to eat more cause tbh except my daily steps and daily workouts (which I barely have the energy to do), I just cannot do anything. I stay in bed. My head hurts. I feel like I'm about to faint each time I stand up. I'm just exhausted and it's ruining my life even more. 

Damn I swear guys I would LOVE to eat more. To feel energized for once. To tone up a bit. But I'm so, so, so scared I'll put on fat rather than muscle or rather than using these calories as energy. 

Literally been crying all morning cause I'm going PSYCHO over this, I'm so fucking obsessed all I can think about is THIS question, I don't even think about my bf anymore I just think of fat, muscles, energy levels, and calories. I'm going crazy. Btw i have enough fat on my body, it's not an issue. But I don't want to get more fat.

In times like these I just want to kill myself honestly. I mean I always want to kill myself but even more in these moments. 

If anyone has knowledge that would answer my question... Please help me",14wnudk,7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14wnudk/vent_and_question_i_cant_do_this_anymore_im_so/,AnorexiaNervosa

1877,Edtwt non intentionally makes you want to get worse (TW),"Can we talk about the social expectations for commenting on someone else’s post depending on their weight? 

That might be a bad way to phrase it. 

I’ve just noticed that when someone is slightly under weight on edtwt the comments are either praise “you’re so tiny” or congratulating weight loss.

But when someone is severely underweight the comments are “it’s okay to recover” “I’m worried about you” “stay safe”.

Death/health risks can happen at any weight w EDs. But with me at least when I see comments like that they just make me think ““I’m not that bad” “I can do a lot worse why am I worried about my health” “maybe I’m not actually that skinny”

Shame grows from secrets hidden in the dark, right? 

I was vegan for a long time (and I'm severely allergic to dairy, so in a way that made it easier). Then vegetarian. And then I was lightly pescatarian, where I had eggs ocassionally (which I tried to ethically source) and sushi maybe a few times a year. 

But then I married my husband, and he started making bacon. The smell... God it smelled so good. Usually I'm put off by meat cooking smells, but not bacon. 

I held out/refused for a really long time, but he kept temtping me. And I caved. And holy shit bacon is delicious. It's like I can't help myself now. I'm still not eating it regularly, but when he cooks it, or a craving hits... I can't help myself in a way I haven't really experienced with other food.

I still have a lot embarassment and shame about it, but simultaneously I need to gain weight and be less restrictive.

Never have I had this much difficulty regulating my cravings. 

I honestly have no clue how to break the cycle. I've tried to eat normally, but it's either calorie counting or overeating. If I can't count calories, I end up eating more than what is healthy. I'm overeating and my stomach is bloated. I'm going to restrict tomorrow and see how it goes. I'm scared of getting fat, but my doctors and nurse don't seem to understand that I'm fat as it is.

1893,I'm scared I'm going to relapse,"So, im 16 and has quite a tough year. I was struggling and eventually that lead me to restrict my eating. At first I hated it when my friend talked to me like to a disordered person (I read quite a lot about psychology, so I kinda know how to talk to struggling people), cause I didn't eat because I didn't feel like. But then it started: checking calories, eating less and less. At some point it was really bad. On a good day I would eat maybe 800kcal (but during the day I used to burn quite some chunk of that, pe, walking, things like that), on a bad day I would not eat at all. I got to the point that when during Christmas I started to eat more (love my aunt's food) I got thoughts like ""you're gonna get fat"", ""you're eating too much"". And that was the moment I knew I had to stop it

So I tried to eat more, in the meanwhile I cut off my toxic friend (the one that was treating me like a walking disorder, he was toxic for other reasons), my depression (alleged) eased and I got my normal weight. Now I can eat and everything, but I notice that more and more I start to look at the calories again. I don't want to do it, I try everything to just distract my mind and eat

But at the same time I kind of miss it. I miss feeling totally horrible. I miss almost passing out during pe (I know how it sounds). I miss not having to eat. I miss being able to sleep (for past week I've been having terrible problems with falling and staying asleep). I don't want to worry my new friends (not that new, but they didn't know me at the time when I was struggling), but at the same time I don't really want to fight it 

I don't know what to do. Started to post recently so I can ease my mind. If you think you may help me please just comment

Most of the time I’ve been heavily restricting, but I made a move toward recovery a few months ago and started working with a nutritionist. Long story short, I gained weight rapidly and haven’t been able to look in the mirror since. My current weight is considered overweight. I’ve gotten dozens of blood tests, seen tons of doctors, and no one has an explanation for why I gained so much weight and why I am continuing to gain weight despite barely eating.

This is gonna sound so stupid. I recognize that everything i’m saying is ridiculous and small and doesn’t matter, but as i’m currently lying here on my yoga mat sobbing about my body I think I need to put these thoughts somewhere.

My ED is deeply tied to a need for male validation. I’ve never been pretty and all my friends have always been like supermodel level. Every boyfriend I’ve had has said my friends are prettier than me, my body is weird, and have overall confirmed to me all of the fears i have about my body.

So, I don’t know what to do. I’m 22 and i’ve never had someone genuinely want me. I’m 22 and I’m trying my hardest to recover, but my worst fears are coming true. I don’t think I’m meant to recover. I think I’m supposed to always be like this so at least I’m not pretty but i’m working towards being thin. I wake up every morning and wish I could just vanish. I don’t want to go to work I don’t want to see friends I don’t want to do anything.

1905,I think I've relapsed. Advice?,"Hello. I was in recovery for 2 years, but recently, I unintentionally lost weight, and now I'm finding myself scared of calories and weight gain again. I'm under eating again. This has been going on for a month. 

And yesterday, my brother cooked salmon in olive oil for me. I ate most of it, but I threw away the skin when he wasn't looking. I love the skin, but I was terrified of the oil that was on it.

It's so tempting for me to try and get underweight again. I'm so close.

I don't want to restrict again, but I have no idea how to stop being scared of calories and weight gain. And my depression isn't helping at all. When I'm depressed, I lose my appetite and I lose any motivation to cook. 

I'm depressed, because I'm currently living with my older brother and he's controlling and has gotten physically abusive a few times. He also sexually assaulted me 8 years ago and I don't think I'm over it.

1906,why can’t i stop thinking about food?,"since i started recovery, i have been eating a lot more and exercising less (per my doctor’s orders). i’m still not eating as much as my doctor wants me to in order to gain weight, though. right now, i’ve finally gotten to a point where i’m no longer losing weight and am just maintaining underweight. 

i thought now that i’m eating more frequently throughout the day and just more in general that food wouldn’t always be on my mind, but it is. i don’t know if me constantly thinking about food is a sign of hunger, because i’ve pretty much lost all of my hunger cues, but it’s always on my mind and i can’t stop. 

considering that i’m eating a normal amount to finally maintain my weight now, it seems weird to still be thinking about food all the time. does anyone know why this is happening and what i can do to stop it?",14uezyy,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14uezyy/why_cant_i_stop_thinking_about_food/,AnorexiaNervosa
1907,was the psychologist wrong to do this," 

I guess I'm just looking for validation here but I need to get this out   
I had an appointment with someone to assess what to do with me, refer me to a therapist kind of thing ..  
We talked a lot about general screening stuff like you know, the family and everything   
But the reason I got referred is the ED  
I  understand she was trying to assess the ""severity"" but when she  blatantly asked me how many calories I would aim for when I was really  restricting, I immediately burst out crying and couldn't answer because  I'm ashamed it's not bad enough and there's also the fact that I didn't  even freaking calorie count at my worst restricting phase, which I  didn't bother explaining. She also asked how much weight I lost in total  which fuckinh triggered me, but I answered anyway. (I'm not even 100%  sure what my start weight was)  
I consented to being  Weighed which was a terrible idea because again, I do not feel sick  enough. I feel a horrible disordered pressure to get worse before the  next appointment in a month or so now. I'm trying so hard to maintain  yet failing some days and just fighting with myself.  
Is it wrong of her to ask me about the numbers??? I just feel defeated and silly ?",14uegtm,35,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14uegtm/was_the_psychologist_wrong_to_do_this/,AnorexiaNervosa

1919,Just got my period back but have mixed emotions :/,"Hi, this is my first time posting here and I need some advice please. (Apologies for being so long, I just don’t know what to do anymore) I’m 22f and recently diagnosed w AN. I started intentionally losing weight (healthfully at first) around 2020. My grandma had passed in 2019 and we were really close so it affected me pretty badly. I gained a BUNCH of weight and so I decided I needed to change my habits. At first, things were great- I lost weight steadily, and I barely noticed things were different- other than wanting to be more active and my old clothes fit again. Then coworkers, friends, even my family, started making comments about how great I looked. Clothes started getting loose, and then really loose so i had to get new ones. I kind of liked all of the attention I was getting about it, and I reveled in all of the new energy i had. It quickly spiraled in 2022 to where I was dropping sizes in weeks, and making goals to exercise more, eat less, and reach previously unthought of clothing sizes. I started comparing myself to thinner people, and my mother who’d been thin my entire life encouraged it. I broke up with my boyfriend (lots of reasons, mainly we were toxic together) and started sleeping with a guy at work. It ended BADLY (also a lot of reasons, but essentially I was a lot to handle: he noticed my eating habits and how I lost my period in April that same year). I stopped showing up to work quickly after that and that’s when things got REALLY bad. I started treating the weight loss like self-harm, I set unrealistic goals (like wanting to fit into children’s clothes, low weight, etc), and continued to overexercise until I’d feel faint. I moved back into my ex-boyfriends place and he tried to get help for me but each time, I’d either lie to my therapist, or just not show up to her or the doctor’s offices in general. My heart rate got scary low, i fit into goal sizes and was under my gw but STILL had dysmorphia, and I was starting to really show pretty much every sign of malnutrition I had heard of. It got so bad and finally, in March this year, I thought I was going to d** and it scared tf out of me. So I started to recover by myself bc I didn’t want to go to the doctor and hear how bad it was. I finally got my period back today but I’m so scared I’m going to relapse because I’m finally “healthy” again. I don’t know that for sure, and I feel like it hasn’t been enough time to fully recover. But idk, not having a period was really validating to my ED that in a way, it makes me unhappy that I’ve got it back. Like I’ve failed. I know I need to stay on track, and keep the weight I’ve gained but I get so guilty about eating anything at this point in recovery. That I’ve eaten enough and now I can stop again. I don’t think I can see my therapist anymore after all of the ghosting the past year and I don’t have many options for counseling as I live in a small town. How do I keep myself motivated to stay in remission? Any tips/advice/nice comments welcome. I just don’t want to feel alone anymore and every day I eat, is another day I disappoint myself 😭",14tq9d6,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14tq9d6/just_got_my_period_back_but_have_mixed_emotions/,AnorexiaNervosa

1921,What's going on with me?,"What's going on with me?

I (16F) have been having anorexia since 2020, and lately I've been switching between anorexia and bulimia (via laxatives, starving or trying to purge). My psicologist gave me firstly some light meds for this problem, and in the last period I've been on a little dose of antidepressant.
Although, it's been a week since I've been not taking them. I can't exactly explain why I decided to stop taking them (without telling both my parents and doctor) but my deviated brain from the eating disorder, convinces me that I've been taking back the weight I lost because of them.
I haven't Felt the rebound effects from stopping the antidepressants cycle, but lately I've been feeling very exhausted. Of course I'm emotionally drained or overstimulated from the lack of meds, but now I feel letargic, I struggle at staying up for too much and I have brain fog and dizziness. And, thinking well, I had All those symptoms before starting taking the meds. Lately Also I've been Trying to move and starve more but I either had to eat because of my parents, even tho I had lots and lots of mental breakdowns because of it. I don't know what to think. Is my body shutting down even tho im not as skinny as I was one year ago (and now I'm almost on an average weight)?

1930,so... is anorexia suddenly a competition about how much better of a person you are now?,"This is for those who have commented on the post about the friend that blew up after being told ""then eat""

OP literally insisted that they wanted to help even though their friend rightfully told them that they dont have to be there for her and that they can set a boundary to not talk about her ED, their friend was mindful that they dont have to be there for her when it comes to her disease because EDs are very complicated and exhausting, but she specifically told them not to give her advice because some peoples advice can suck because they dont have an ED so they wont understand, but they still gave her the stupid advice of ""then eat"". No shit shes going to blow up. Was it the best response? No, of course not. It was a *reasonable* response but not an excuse, it was inappropriate behavior and she should have reacted in a more civil matter, dont get me wrong about that

But after the blow up, OP said they still want to help, THEY SAID IT, and that they have also vented to her about their own problems about their weight, IT'S IN THE POST! She isnt the only person venting. They also said that they can also be toxic to her, they that their toxic moments like this *to each other* are so rare and have been friends for FIFTEEN YEARS, and you guys are telling them that she isnt their friend? Seriously? We're not r/relationship_advice where we tell people to split up, we are r/AnorexiaNervosa and the lack of empathy is disgusting. There are comments saying that she is saddling them with too much responsibility, that she isnt their friend, that she was being manipulative and other terrible things about her. Are you serious rn? Do you guys seriously think you have never blown up like this towards a loved one ever whether its because of your ED affecting your moods or any other reason? You guys are seriously crucifying her over one fucking screenshot and I bet yall didnt even read the post at all because there have been comments missing the fact that OP was rightfully given the freedom to put boundaries between them when it comes to venting about her ED as she should because she knows that people shouldnt be responsible with her problems

Read what OP said in one of their comments ""We have been friends for 15 years and I was heartbroken when you said she was manipulative but now that I know that anorexia is a manipulative disorder, I feel calm about it. Weve had our up and downs, even me when I have developed depression so I understand and I dont want to give up on her just like she never gave up on me. Toxicity happens between us, but it is rare, that's why we hold each other up. If it was toxic in general then thats different, but theres never a non toxic moment in friendship. It is very very rare and we are very happy together""

Before you say ""but that wasnt in the post, they said it in a comment, how were we supposed to know that they have been friends for 15 years and that theyve had rare toxic moments to each other and not just her to OP?"" YOU DIDNT KNOW ANYTHING AND STILL ASSUMED! You didnt know if OP has been toxic to their friend or not and you still chose to demonize her as the only friend being toxic. You CHOSE to criminalize her without knowing their backstory. My fucking god

By the way, someone told OP she was being manipulative and OP said that they were sad to know they were being manipulated by their friend. They got bombarded with downvotes for believing what *someone else* told them, but the person who decided to paint her as a manipulative friend got away with it scott free for making OP believe that she was being manipulative, no downvotes. I dont care that there are bots, I *know* they are also downvotes from actual redditors

Seriously, I am disappointed. To think you guys are better just because of one fucking screenshot. No context and still decided to only view her as this evil person. Props to those who criticized OP for not listening to her while also saying that she was in the wrong for blowing up like that. Nothing else. No accusations, no making up stories about how much of a horrible friend she is, nothing. Shame on those who did

1931,Am I tricking everyone?,"Hi all, I am new to this sub and new to this diagnosis. I’m hoping I am not breaking any rules by asking this question, sorry in advance if I do. This is kind of long so I will put a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’ve had disordered eating for the past 10 years. 3 years ago, I was talking to a friend about it and she said “actually, that sounds like an all out eating disorder, you need to talk to your doctor and therapist”. I did, and they came back saying I had a binge eating disorder. 

This is relevant to the story and I don’t want to discuss numbers, but I live in a bigger body. I have experienced medical discrimination because of my weight in all aspects of my health, not just my eating disorder. 

Also relevant: I had a major health crisis this year and was eventually diagnosed with endometriosis. The diagnosis process was awful and took six months and too many doctors to count, and I was in ridiculous pain the whole time. I eventually got my diagnosis and was put on a medication for the endo. 

I talked at length with my OBGYN about my concerns with getting pregnant due to the endometriosis, and we decided together I should go on another medication that has both an antidepressant and an appetite suppressant, so that I could lose weight to help with pregnancy. Please keep in mind this whole time we all thought I had a BINGE eating disorder. 

This month, I got a new therapist. The old one turned out to have a lot of antiquated ideas (like “you can’t have ADHD if you did well in school) and I didn’t feel like I was doing the work I needed to be doing, so I found a new one. In our discussions, she told me that she thinks I don’t have a binge eating disorder; I have anorexia. 

Trying not to go into too much detail, but basically I restrict for such large periods of time that eventually I have a breakdown and binge, but then go back to restricting. The therapist says this is indicative of anorexia and that anorexia is often misdiagnosed in plus size people because “how could you have anorexia if you are fat”. 

My problem: I have not told the OBGYN about the new diagnosis. I am still taking the medication with the appetite suppression. My husband and friends AND therapist think it’s okay because it was prescribed to me because of the endometriosis and my want to be pregnant and because it has done wonders for my depression. I don’t want to tell the OBGYN. I want to keep taking it. It is making me lose weight. I have myself mostly convinced that if I can get to a healthy weight, I can fix my relationship with food in the meantime. Part of me does want to get better. But part of me doesn’t. Part of me LOVES this. And that’s the part that scares me. 

TL;DR: 
I was put on a medication for my endometriosis and depression that has a side effect of consistent weight loss and I feel like I am tricking my husband, friends, and therapist into letting me keep it just because I am a bigger person with anorexia.

I don’t WANT to be anorexic anymore, I’m almost 28 and frankly I want to ENJOY my life without all this, but I still find caloric intake to be a daily struggle, even after years of therapy.
Anyway, I’ll eat as much as I can, and for me it feels like a lot. Like I sincerely feel full, but then the server comes by and makes these comments like “oh no you didn’t like it?” Or “was there something wrong with your food?” And like, I wish I could just say “I have an eating disorder and this is the best I can do today” but yknow you can’t like SAY that so I usually make up some bs about how I had a big meal a couple hours earlier or something.

It really took a turn when I was hospitalized and the hospital had really really good vegetation meals and you could have as much as you want. I gained so much during those two hospitalizations. I just want to get my old body back. I look back at pictures when I was in the grip of my eating disorder and I miss it. I didn’t think I was thin back then but God I see it now. You never know how good you have it till it’s gone. I’m scared of relapsing mostly because of how shaky I get when I don’t eat and how easily I pass out. I’m still going to eat though so I can keep from passing out. 

This is my first post on here. I’m new to this subreddit. If I made any mistake in this post that goes against the rules, I completely understand it being taken down. I read the rules fairly well but I might have misread them and made an error. I apologize if I did.

1935,Slipping into old (maybe worse) habits,"I know that I had bulimia my freshman year of high school because it was very obvious - I threw up after every meal (on purpose). I knew that I was addicted to pain killers because I took them multiple times a day for several years. My father moved out of the house a year before - incase anyone was wondering what the catalyst was.

I am now 25(F) and am suddenly struggling with disordered eating and addiction again. Now I am having trouble with appetite and instead find myself saving my ""appetite"" for alcohol. I barely have an appetite, and I realize that I am just saving the calories for the seltzers I am ingesting.  I feel like I am about to cry all the time. I am afraid my boyfriend is going to catch on and tell my family. I am afraid they will commit me to the hospital. I just want to be normal.

&#x200B;

How do I help myself? How do I ask for help?

I have never had to ask for help before - I was privileged enough that the help was provided. As an adult teacher, I feel I should have it together and be able to help myself, but I feel incapable.

&#x200B;

I am the support system for every loved one, friend, and family member in my life. In addition to that, I am a support system for hundreds of students and their families. I have a therapist, but I am not sure I am able to admit the role I play in other people's lives because I feel I sound self absorbed when I do so. I don't think I am a massive part of any of these people's lives, but I certainly don't want to disappoint them.

Everything about modern society has led me to believe that I should not be posting this, and I am fully committed to taking it down in the morning.

1936,Mom says I’m her “inspiration” shortly after I was diagnosed w/ anorexia,"I kind of want to give the whole build up to this story just because I am in such a state of like disarray and need to get my thoughts out and explain everything and just breathe but: Finally had my doctors apt for my eating issues today and was diagnosed anorexic. My mom was in the room with me for this and was a big part of my whole journey into recovery ish stuff. For context, my mother is a basically the poster child for disordered eating, always yo-yo dieting w/ radical weight shifts and generally very insecure (always trying to get me on some fad diet as well). I hate to blame my issues on her but the truth is a lot of it is because of her. When I first went to college I dropped a lot of weight because I was anxious and had a lot of work and developed an omad type routine. I was quite overweight at this time so no one was concerned when I dropped some weight and she even told me multiple times that I should “stick to my one yogurt a day” whenever I complained about my body. (I hate making my mother out to sound bad she is a deeply troubled woman who does have good intentions but truthfully sometimes it seems otherwise). Anyway. Flash forward now I again dropped a ton of weight but this time it was concerning and after months of semi worry I finally confessed about my eating habits (or lack of). She was concerned but quickly I realized that she thought it was fine as long as I had a little food each day, as opposed to nothing…I’m sure I don’t have to explain that this is not recovering and kinda allowed me to carry on my disordered habits further along than I should have been able to. My confession went hand in hand with many breakdowns about my hair loss (my hair has always been my one of my favorite things about myself), my anxiety to see friends and family due to food, the anxiety cycles I constantly put myself in counting all my calories, etc etc. Despite all of this though, I had this nagging feeling that my mom’s attitude towards me wasn’t all pity and concern and unfortunately this was confirmed for me after the appointment. We went to Trader Joe’s and she was trying to buy me ice cream to which I told her I wasn’t really a fan of pre packaged ice creams (i am scared). She started reading calorie counts to me and honestly I knew she was just trying to help and get me something “low calorie” so I would eat it but I didn’t budge. She eventually stopped and started shopping around for herself, aggressively checking and reading calorie counts out loud, not something she ever did before . So I tell her essentially “please don’t be like me and drive yourself crazy over those numbers, just let yourself live.” To which she replies, “no you’re my inspiration.” 

This was a gut punch because honestly I knew she felt this way, when I told her about my disorder she referred to it as “amazing” that I could “starve myself to this point”(mind you I’m not even uw😭😭). I basically said in reply that I “can’t even sleep at night because I’m up psychotically counting calories and I’m your inspiration?” (to which she replied “still?”) I had had it so I went on all like “my hair is falling out and I lost my period and I’m your inspiration?” 

She ended up apologizing but that doesn’t change what she said or how she feels. I just felt so alone after that because it felt like all those tearful times were nothing to her like she was holding me as I cried just envious of my weight loss. I am losing all eloquence right now but it just felt like my only support system evaporated with one comment. I’ve really been only relying on my mom because I haven’t wanted to bother my friends with my issues especially when they are so sensitive and deep-rooted and so all I had was my mom who I feel like I don’t even have and I just feel more isolated than ever after that. She just doesn’t get it, this is all a fun game to her or something I don’t know but I feel awful and alone.",14rxqnh,9,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14rxqnh/mom_says_im_her_inspiration_shortly_after_i_was/,AnorexiaNervosa
1937,I honestly never know how anorexia works like this,"I cant make sense right now, Im high

I wanted to walk but didnt have the confidence to eat. I hate being semi-handicapped (unless thats invalidating to those who also cant stand for a certain amount of time), so I smoked weed. When I restrict, weed doesnt make me crave, but it doed help me be confident in eating, so thats what I did

Things didnt suck. Sure my stomach was uncomfortable and bloating, but then my realization hit

I ate food

Im near about to cry. I thought it was going so well and that I felt like everything was going to be ok but no. Here I am feeling like shit for literally doing what every person *should* do to survive and fucking ans is shaming the fuck out of me for it, for ""losing control"", ""being careless"", ""being a disgusting pig"". Of course thats not true but my brain so believes it

TW GORE THOUGHTS BEFORE THE READER KNOWS WHAT I MEAN

I dont do self harm purposely, but sometimes I wish I could just grab a sharo kitchen knife and cut off my stomach and that it would all work. Obviously I dont have any desires to actually do that, that shit scares me, I could never. I mean that in a less gorey way, like cutting up cotton candy that wouldnt bleed and would stay the same.

1939,Relapse has helped me understand my ED,"I've been ""in remission"" for almost a year now. Right now I'm going through a relapse, I'm quite aware of this but my disorder is louder than my reason and I don't want to do anything about it at this point. But that's not what I'm posting about.

Having had a hell of a few years and having had the chance to experience many different things I see a lot clearer what helped me to recover and what is causing me now to need to fall back into old habits and it feels like a breakthrough.

The one thing I think I lacked most is connection and on some level love, I was completely isolated when my disorder started. 

I was never bullied but I felt invisible and my mother treated me like I was a monster, I found solace in the company of that little voice I created in my head, it was better than finding peace with myself because I was obviously in some way tainted to have deserved the treatment I was getting.

The numbers helped to blend out the feelings of inferiority, I would rather have thought for hours about one piece of bread than to let them invade that space.

I made friends in my remission period, many of them, I was almost popular in some sense. Having moved out of my family home my mothers disgusted looks didn't rule me anymore. I learned to open myself up a little bit and dropped out of school, which was another thing that I would've done anything to avoid.

I didn't need all those supplement drinks to recover, I needed someone to look me in the eyes and tell me I am okay the way I am.",14rrbeq,13,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14rrbeq/relapse_has_helped_me_understand_my_ed/,AnorexiaNervosa

I told him it used to be nicer and that it had “deflated” a bit since I lost weight recently. I didn’t go into detail and he didn’t ask. He proceeded to ask if I had more energy and felt “lighter and bouncier” since losing weight. And complimented how “petite” I was. I’m sure if he knew the circumstances, he wouldn’t have said anything and was probably just trying to validate(what he probably assumes) is healthy weight loss. I just can’t stop thinking about how validating it was. It made me feel so proud of myself even though I know what I’m doing isn’t healthy",14rn2t6,19,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14rn2t6/hookup_validated_my_weight/,AnorexiaNervosa

I am absolutely shattered. Therapy was my lifeline. I actually was starting to do a little better. I do understand that he has a life,and circumstances can change quite suddenly and it might have been something he could not foresee. I just thought a phone call or email would have been nice. He had told me months ago that he was considering changing practices, but if he did he would definitely let me know. After many months went by I assumed he had decided to stay. This is the reason I did not want to do therapy in the first place,and I definitely will not again. I feel abandoned and undeserving of treatment or basic care. I of course have my husband who is supportive, but he doesn't quite understand why this is so difficult for me to actually accept and get my mind around. I just am so stressed out already.

But the food guilt kicks in the worst when Im eating before going to bed . It feels kinda u nnecessary .

Can someone tell me how to overcome this food guilt?

Is it right or good to eat short time before going to bed?

I'm 5 months into AN recovery. I've been weight restored for 3 months per my dietician  - apparently I'm the quickest gainer she's ever seen 🥴.

Could anyone else who has made it this far in recovery share a little about their experiences with physical pain and body aches? Maybe duration and places where your aches were especially bothersome?

I'll start. The first 2 months, my stomach was sensitive to the touch. The 2nd two months, lower back was the same. For the past month, my thighs and calves are sore as heck, especially sitting in my office chair 8 hours a day.

Any feedback would be appreciated and make me feel like this is perhaps normal at this point. For some context, I'm a 34yo male, so maybe my body won't bounce back as fast as the spring chickens, especially after a decade of restriction.

1956,Wound up in emergency last night,"Hey, this story isn't one of those! I wound up in the ER last night, basically due to persistent chest pain. I would have likely just seen a family doc, but thats been impossible where I live, and after a tele-health appointment and a prescription of antibiotics (which surprise surprise did nothing for a viral infection.). I ended up going to the ER on the advice of a triage nurse (chest pain= go to hospital, do not pass go, do not collect $200). 

The last time I had an ECG I was very seriously ill and had arrythmia, abnormalities and bradycardia. The nurse who checked me out asked if I'd ever had to have this kind of test before (being a young, seemingly healthy person), and so we chatted about it and I said the last time I'd had one I was \*\*\* lbs and she was shocked and asked me how I'd overcome my ED. 

Anyway long story short, I have a bad case of bronchitis, but the docs (the ER doc) and nurse all said I was young, healthy and would fight it off. They asked how long I'd been recovered, and told me how beautiful and healthy I looked. It could have been triggering (and a part of me still wasn't totally comfortable) but honestly it's a relief. Its a relief to know I'm doing so well- the doc said that my vitals looked good and I can go home when I have a nasty virus and trust my body is strong enough to cope! 

If you are reading this, please know, you can get to this place too, recovery is difficult, but you too will be beautiful and healthy, please keep going, seriously. <3

I’ve been thinking about all of this for awhile, but after a slip I had recently I’m feeling really overwhelmed. I’ve been struggling with not only alcohol, but also anorexia on top of that. It’s been rough because the slip up with drinking happened at the same time that my weight dropped a lot. I can feel everything catching up to me. My brain just… doesn’t seem to work. My stomach is messed up. Sleep isn’t great. I have no motivation or energy to do anything. All I’ve been able to do the past few days is watch random shows. Can’t hold a conversation to save my life, can’t do simple tasks to take care of myself in any way, shape or form. That was made very clear while on a trip with friends last week. I noticed how everyone else could just go through the mornings with regular routines… and I was a hot mess, holding everyone back. I truly mean I couldn’t do simple, daily tasks. Oh yeah I’m also under a lot of pressure to get my career going… and I can hardly get dressed for the day in a timely manner. So I feel like that’s not high on my list of priorities right now. 

I already go to therapy, psychiatry, nutritionist, primary care… with all of the tools they’ve given me I can’t seem to make a change. I need a reset but I’m not sure how. I have the option to move back in with my mom (which I’m very grateful for) but last time I lived at home I was extremely depressed. But shit, I’m depressed now.

I “recovered” seemingly by accident, around 2021. I just… started eating. And I didn’t stop. I realized two things had been keeping me thin: a certain ADHD medication, and wanting to look good for my girlfriend at the time. When I had to quit both, it’s like a switch flipped in me. Full 180. 

All at once I wanted to fill the void inside me. I’ve been bulimic on and off. But I don’t ever really binge, I just eat like a normal person. None of the conditions really fit me. (Just like my clothes.) I don’t want to sound melodramatic or whiny or self-pitying tho. 
I just really feel like I can’t do anything right. Can’t recover right can’t starve right. 

The most fucked up thing is that my self hatred and body image issues are the *worst they’ve ever been.* Correlated with the weight gain. I was actually happier when I was thin— even though at the time I wasn’t fully aware that I was thin. And my methods were literally killing me. 

My mother recently said to me “I think you have some sort of rexia.” Which was a stupid thing for her to say, she’s a few years too late. What she meant to say was body dysmorphia. Because she was referring to the fact that I refused to look at a photo of myself that she was trying to show me on her phone. But is it even body dysmorphia if I’m objectively the heaviest I’ve ever been? That’s body *dysphoria.* 

Anyway, I couldn’t trigger myself into relapsing even if I tried. I’m going off to college finally next month and I’m hoping all the walking and the free gym will save me from myself. Cuz I know that my current state isn’t healthy, but that being anorexic and underweight was worse for me, even if I’ve romanticized it and sanitized it.

1963,I injured myself and don't know how to figure it out,"
Hi everyone, I'm asking you for tips to make up this situation
I felt on the stairs and broke my leg, and because of other injuries I just cannot move. I have to stay all the day in bed, and have to eat to fix my bones, but it's panicking to me. 
I just can't stand not moving, it's planned for like 12 weeks and that's insanely huge and I'm just thinking of the weight that I'll gain, by eating and not moving, I already feel like I have taken so much even if I know that it can't be possible because the accident happened like 3 days ago but wow it's so hard
Does anyone have any idea to try to not just thinking about that ? Or maybe some tricks to make my brain thinking that I'm not just gaining weight ?",14qcmwr,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14qcmwr/i_injured_myself_and_dont_know_how_to_figure_it/,AnorexiaNervosa
1964,How do you guys get your mindset better?,I have had really bad body issues for a couple years now. Now I’m 16 and my obsession was getting the numbers on the scale down and not to see my “woman pouch” as what i call it. I can’t stand it but I’m obsessed with both of those now but also with the need to have to see my bones. I have such a deep fear of not being able to see my bones or for the numbers to go up it’s been consuming me. I am especially worried about going to the beach for a week here soon and wearing a bathing suit. I can’t stand how i look but i just want to feel good about myself.

I said “it doesn’t work like that I can’t turn off anorexia off like a light switch and that her getting angry and shitty at me will trigger me “

This caused a massive argument as she said so it her fault that I’m not eating as I said she’s the trigger.

1971,I can't stop hoarding food and drinks,"I just cant. The reason why I hoard food and drinks is because I feel safe from not missing out on them, I also feel a lot of power? If I don't keep them then I will get anxious and regretful

This wouldnt be a problem if I wasnt so obsessed with what I eat. When I restrict, I only, ONLY eat meat, fruit and vegetables and only those. They cannot mix with anything, not even tajin and chamoy even though there are no numbers on them, if you know what I mean sad white mexican noises. I dont think my hoarding would be a problem if I wasn't so fixated on what I eat. I know that if I were to eat sweets everyday with the amount I eat, I would still lose weight (in an unhealthy way, unfortunately, with or without sweets), so I dont see why the anorexic part of my mind is so much stronger than the logic part of my mind. I know damn well it wouldnt change anything and yet, nope! I am not allowed to have sny other kind of food, says my eating disorder, which is sad. I dont get it. The only time I can eat this without much of a problem is when I would ""binge"" (not really binge but you know what I mean), and either way, my ""binging"" phased have gotten shorter and shorter and less eating and less eating. This is such a nightmare. My plan is to eat them with my girlfriend when she comes back from college. She's the only person I am not territorial with my food, just like she feels the same way with me. I would gladly eat what I have hoarded, with her

We were both overweight but now shes underweight and im heavier

When she first told me she was diagnosed with anorexia i

told her to be open with me if she ever wants to vent

But she told me [copy paste] ""I'm warning you that we are very complicated to deal with, very stressful and the things we complain can be very stupid to those who don't have eating disorders, such as crying and getting full blown traumatic panic attacks for taking a bite out of an ice cream, and then we also complain about really serious stuff like fainting, low blood sugar, pale, unable to walk, and other things so it's up to you if you want to be there for me when it comes to this, and if you want to I would rather you not give me advice since many people's advice can be... ergh... insensitive when they aren't professionals (even many professionals can say insensitive comments since we are very complicated), even if they mean well. If you want to be there for me you can just support me like good luck, get better, sorry to hear, etc"" and thats what ive been doing but then this happened and idk what to do.

  My ED used to be more intense (obsessively counting calories 6 days a week), but now it's more casual (never counting calories; eating a normal amount most days; eating as little as possible or throwing up on days where I'm on drugs.). BTW, is it still ""bulimia"" if I only throw up from taking cough medicine, which I primarily use to get high?

1975,What is it like having parents that know your eating disorder?,"Im getting exhausted hiding and getting out of situations, such as eating, answering their ""why did this happen?"" questions when it comes to my eating disorder symptoms, their constant going out to eat, fake eating, etc. Im done

The reason why I haven't told them is because I don't know if they will get upset, that they won't take me serious about the whole ""you can't force me to eat"", especially since I am not underweight and I will continue to try and recover on my own, especially since it started to get worse since last month. I am very aware of whats going on to me and what I should do, so theres no need for them to be on my ass

Were going to the doctor to check out whats going on with me. Third time losing consciousness and falling down in a bird position, no shaking so no seizure. I know why its happening but I dont know what it is, so I want to tell my doctor that I am ready to confess since, well, I am at the doctor and a doctor can confirm that yes, they shouldnt be upset, they should tell me to ""CHIIIIIIILL"" like my brother does when I react to the calories like I don't have a fucking eating disorder, and that they shouldnt force me to eat, but rather softly encourage me but not continue if I say no. I have phases of eating more than usual, so it is less deadly for me luckily

What is it like having parents/a family that knows about your eating disorder? Also, don't ever, EVER again ask me ""why are you telling people about your eating disorder?"" I'm not going to be ashamed so fuck off.

I’ve mostly been trying to just be conscious of when these rules come into play, like if I go to do something and it goes against one of my rules and because of that I feel bad about doing it, and trying to work against that thought process. But it’s been hard, and maybe it’s just that it’s a slow process, but I wanted to ask if anybody has any advice on this.

1985,my mom doesn't believe me,"for context, i have struggled with disordered eating for the majority of my life, due to an extensive history with CSA and abuse. after being in (my first) relationship with a narcissist, i developed full-blown AN, and it got pretty bad fairly quickly. for the past three years, i have struggled to feel okay in my body, feel like i deserve to eat, etc. My body has worn itself down to next to nothing, to put it bluntly, and although I have attempted recovery on my own, it has never proven successful past the point of bringing my body to a slightly more livable form. 

throughout the entirety of this disorder, i have lived with my mother, who adamantly refuses to admit/ accept that i do in fact have an eating disorder, despite being medically diagnosed in her presence. she has watched me torment myself, break down over numbers and my body, obsess, and she has bore witness to the brunt of my cognitive impairments brought on by AN (especially losing my personality, which she has commented on nearly as much as my weight). 

&#x200B;

around two or so months ago, i had gotten myself in \*deep\* trouble for some not-so-great decisions of mine, and whilst she was scolding and berating me, she brought up anorexia. i told her that i resented her for never getting me any sort of help, and for never even being there for me herself, and her reply back has sent me into an emotional downfall. ""i dont believe you have anorexia, i really do think you're doing this all for attention"". that was her exact response. 

i tried giving her the benefit of the doubt- perhaps she said it out of emotion in the moment- however, she reiterated that statement several times in a sound state of mind, and i am devastated, to put it lightly. i have struggled with so much, and have neared death on several occasions now. 

i know that i should not let her words affect my recovery, but that alongside some other events in my life have caused me to spiral further and further down the relapse rabbit-hole. in my head, the only way to get my mother's approval (of which i so desperately vie for) is to get exponentially worse, even perhaps die, just so she will listen. 

i really do love my mother, i just want (and need) her to see me, instead of pushing me aside and writing me off. i just want to feel like i am not faking it. ",14p5cl5,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/14p5cl5/my_mom_doesnt_believe_me/,AnorexiaNervosa
